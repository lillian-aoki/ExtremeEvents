Because the survey period coincided with a mixture of dry and wet years (drought from 2004 to 2007 followed by flood rainfall in early 2008 and 2010), it is particularly valuable as a preliminary benchmark upon which to base management decisions. Most of the population (74.5%) was in the Broad Sound area in the north, with lower numbers in the Fitzroy River delta area in the south (22%) and at Curtis Island (3.5%). Sites on Torilla Plain in Broad Sound accounted for two-thirds of the estimated population, making it a priority for conservation efforts. Depending on habitat configuration, some Capricorn Yellow Chats showed a seasonal pattern of habitat use, moving from flooded breeding habitats as they dried to refuge sites such as salt fields or upper marine plains in the dry season; distances moved being < 10 km. Standard surveys from Torilla Plain showed that the chat count during a sequence of aboveaverage rainfall years was almost double that of the average for drought years: 162 +/-28 (2008–2015) compared with 85 +/-15 (2004–2007) respectively. Low population size, large annual fluctuations in population with prior rainfall, rapid declines in low rainfall years, a fragmented distribution and almost half the population concentrated at one site point to a subspecies vulnerable to chance events. Increased climatic extremes predicted by climate change such as higher temperatures, evaporation rates, extended droughts and more intense rainfall events add to its vulnerability.","2018-03","2019-02-10 01:20:22","2019-12-05 00:32:00","2019-02-10 00:43:20","100-115","","01","28","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/JLKLAL5W/Houston et al. - 2018 - Population trend and conservation status of the Ca.pdf","","freshwater; downloaded by Lillian; drought; temperature; downloaded by Rachel; marine; storm; downloaded by Brandon; PDF not available; z excluded - not extreme event","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is, however, growing evidence that environmental (habitat characteristics and biotic interactions) and spatial processes (factors that aﬀect a local assemblage regardless of environmental conditions - typically related to dispersal and movement of species) interactively shape biological assemblages. A metacommunity, which is a set of local assemblages connected by dispersal of individuals, is spatial in nature and can be used as a straightforward approach for investigating the interactive and independent eﬀects of both environmental and spatial processes. Here, we examined (i) how environmental and spatial processes aﬀect the metacommunity organization of marine macroinvertebrates inhabiting the intertidal sediments of a biodiverse coastal ecosystem; (ii) whether the inﬂuence of these processes is constant through time or is aﬀected by extreme weather events (storms); and (iii) whether the relative importance of these processes depends on the dispersal abilities of organisms. We found that macrobenthic assemblages are inﬂuenced by each of environmental and spatial variables; however, spatial processes exerted a stronger role. We also found that this inﬂuence changes through time and is modiﬁed by storms. Moreover, we observed that the inﬂuence of environmental and spatial processes varies according to the dispersal capabilities of organisms. More eﬀective dispersers (i.e., species with planktonic larvae) are more aﬀected by spatial processes whereas environmental variables had a stronger eﬀect on weaker dispersers (i.e. species with low motility in larval and adult stages). These ﬁndings highlight that accounting for spatial processes and diﬀerences in species life histories is essential to improve our understanding of species distribution and coexistence patterns in intertidal soft-sediments. Furthermore, it shows that storms modify the structure of coastal assemblages. Given that the inﬂuence of spatial and environmental processes is not consistent through time, it is of utmost importance that future studies replicate sampling over diﬀerent periods so the inﬂuence of temporal and stochastic factors on macrobenthic metacommunities can be better understood.","2018-05","2019-02-10 01:20:22","2019-12-05 00:31:57","2019-02-10 00:43:21","139-152","","","136","","","When time affects space","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/EATQDVWM/Corte et al. - 2018 - When time affects space Dispersal ability and ext.pdf","","coastal; downloaded by Rachel; marine; storm; downloaded by Alex; z excluded - not extreme event","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Floods and droughts are projected to occur more frequently, but how aquatic species will respond to these extreme events remains uncertain. Based on counts of Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) collected over 28 yr at 115 sites in Shenandoah National Park, we developed mixed-effects models to (1) assess how well extreme streamﬂow, as compared to mean ﬂows and total precipitation, can explain young-of-the-year (YOY) abundance, (2) identify potential nonlinear relationships between seasonal environmental covariates and abundance using nonlinear generalized additive mixed models, and (3) explore likely impacts of expected future weather and streamﬂow conditions. We found that (1) using covariates of streamﬂow extremes improved prediction of YOY abundance compared to use of mean seasonal ﬂow values or precipitation as a proxy, (2) warmer maximum daily spring temperatures were associated with increased YOY abundance up to about 1.5 standard deviations, above which abundance declined, and (3) a strong negative effect of extreme winter streamﬂow, unlikely to be offset by possibly positive effects from other seasons, is expected to have a detrimental impact on Brook Trout populations given predicted increases in winter precipitation. Because YOY abundance is a strong determinant of population dynamics for these short-lived species, extreme events will have the potential to exert a strong inﬂuence on population persistence of Brook Trout in a changing climate. Management actions that maximize resiliency of populations in response to extreme events, such as restoration of habitat connectivity, should be prioritized to buffer negative impacts.","2018-08","2019-02-12 05:29:45","2019-12-05 00:31:45","2019-02-12 05:29:45","e02356","","eight","9","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/L7BM6QK7/Blum et al. - 2018 - Seasonal streamflow extremes are key drivers of Br.pdf","","freshwater; downloaded by Lillian; drought; temperature; storm; downloaded by Brandon; downloaded by Jenna; fresh; read by Dustin; flagged; z excluded - modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The capacity for specific habitat patches within a landscape to modulate stressors from extreme climate events, and animal distribution throughout habitat matrices during events, could influence the degree of population level effects following the passage of ECEs. Here, we ask (i) does the intensity of stressors of an ECE vary across a landscape? And (ii) Do habitat use patterns of a mobile species influence their vulnerability to ECEs? Specifically, we measured how extreme cold spells might interact with temporal variability in habitat use to affect populations of a tropical, estuarine-dependent large-bodied fish Common Snook, within Everglades National Park estuaries (FL US). We examined temperature variation across the estuary during cold disturbances with different degrees of severity, including an extreme cold spell. Second, we quantified Snook distribution patterns when the passage of ECEs is most likely to occur from 2012 to 2016 using passive acoustic tracking. Our results revealed spatial heterogeneity in the intensity of temperature declines during cold disturbances, with some habitats being consistently 3–5°C colder than others. Surprisingly, Snook distributions during periods of greatest risk to experience an extreme cold event varied among years. During the winters of 2013–2014 and 2014–2015 a greater proportion of Snook occurred in the colder habitats, while the winters of 2012–2013 and 2015–2016 featured more Snook observed in the warmest habitats. This study shows that Snook habitat use patterns could influence vulnerability to extreme cold events, however, whether Snook habitat use increases or decreases their vulnerability to disturbance depends on the year, creating temporally dynamic vulnerability. Faunal global change research should address the spatially explicit nature of extreme climate events and animal habitat use patterns to identify potential mechanisms that may influence population effects following these disturbances.","2017-10","2019-02-12 05:36:57","2019-12-05 00:31:49","2019-02-12 05:36:57","4045-4057","","10","23","","","Can animal habitat use patterns influence their vulnerability to extreme climate events?","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/4BINHXGR/Boucek et al. - 2017 - Can animal habitat use patterns influence their vu.pdf","","coastal; freshwater; heat; downloaded by Lillian; temperature; storm; downloaded by Brandon; downloaded by Alex; z excluded - not extreme event","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present a detailed water quality time series for the post-drought recovery period, from the ﬁrst signiﬁcant storm event at the end of the drought through three very wet months during which time the catchment fully wetted up. High-frequency observations were obtained using pump water samplers, at 15-min intervals for storm events and 2 hourly at other times. There are signiﬁcant shifts in discharge-concentration response as the catchment wets up; initial behaviour is very different to later storms. Extreme drought may become more common in a warmer world, so it is increasingly important to understand water quality response during and after such episodes, if their impact on water resources and in-stream ecology is to be better anticipated.

Here, we demonstrate within piedmont valleys of California’s Sierra Nevada, through new and historical data supported by modeling, that anthropogenic fans produced by 19th century gold mining comprise an episodically persistent source of sediment-adsorbed Hg to lowlands. Within the enormous, iconic Yuba Fan, we highlight (i) an apparent shift in the relative processes of fan evolution from gradual vertical channel entrenchment to punctuated lateral erosion of fan terraces, thus enabling entrainment of large volumes of Hg-laden sediment during individual floods, and (ii) systematic intrafan redistribution and downstream progradation of fan sediment into the Central Valley, triggered by terrace erosion during increasingly long, 10-y flood events. Each major flood apparently erodes stored sediment and delivers to sensitive lowlands the equivalent of ∼10–30% of the entire postmining Sierran Hg mass so far conveyed to the San Francisco Bay-Delta (SFBD). This process of protracted but episodic erosion of legacy sediment and associated Hg is likely to persist for >104 y. It creates, within an immense swath of river corridor well upstream of the SFBD, new contaminated floodplain surfaces primed for Hg methylation and augments/replenishes potential Hg sources to the SFBD. Anticipation, prediction, and management of toxic sediment delivery, and corresponding risks to lowland ecology and human society globally, depend on the morphodynamic stage of anthropogenic fan evolution, synergistically coupled to changing frequency of and duration extreme floods.","2013-10-23","2019-02-13 15:03:48","2019-12-05 00:32:12","2019-02-13 15:03:48","201302295","","","","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","©  .

The monitoring project presented here focuses the documentation of the damage following the disturbance event, the identification of co-factors, and is designed to find out significant stressors that may impede the recovery of the reeds. The monitoring is based on CIR aerial photo interpretation, quantitative GIS-analyses and field data. The design of the study implies the definition of five degrees of damage using the interpretation of CIR aerial photo series from July 2000. The aquatic reed beds were digitised and areal sums were calculated. These data were compared with the corresponding data from 1999 and 1993. Stand structural and biomass attributes were investigated in 50 randomly distributed permanent plots covering all site types and damage degrees. The results showed a loss of about 24 hectares of aquatic reeds at Lake Constance Untersee alone. The stands which had survived showed a great patchiness in terms of culm density, shoot population composition, culm architecture, and aboveground biomass production. Severely damaged stands were mainly composed of secondary shoots, whereas primary and insect infested shoots dominated in less damaged stands. One co-factor which explained the patchiness was the vertical position of the stand, i.e. the probability of being severely damaged increased with increasing distance below mean water level. The monitoring programme will be continued till 2003.","2002","2019-02-13 15:45:44","2019-12-05 00:31:37","","131-146","","","32","","","","","","","","","","de","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/A9WKNIY9/Schmieder et al. - 2002 - Auswirkungen des Extremhochwassers 1999 auf die Fl.pdf","","freshwater; storm; downloaded by Brandon; read by Dustin; flagged; z excluded - non english","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many coastal areas can be considered over-stressed systems as a whole, the ecosystem services of which are strongly impaired. This is particularly important in tropical regions, where the coastal zone is under the inﬂuence of a strong climate variability including monsoons and frequent extreme weather events, such as typhoons. During the past decades the continuous development of Hainan’s coastal zone and its hinterland, in combination with episodic natural events (e.g., typhoons), caused environmental changes in its coastal ecosystems. However, little is known on the consequences of environmental changes for the biogeochemistry and ecology and, hence, the natural resources of the Hainan coastal ecosystems. The Sino-German inter-disciplinary LANCET (land–sea interactions along coastal ecosystems of tropical China: Hainan) project was designed to address these issues on a local to regional scale and at the same time, to contribute to the global data base in which this type of information from tropical regions is still under-represented.
