Growing evidence suggests that reduction in body size is a universal response of organisms to global warming. However, a clear understanding of whether extreme climate events will impose selection directly on phenotypic plastic responses and how these responses affect ecological interactions has remained elusive. Methods. We experimentally investigated the effects of extreme desiccation events on antioxidant defense mechanisms of a rocky intertidal gastropod (Patella ulyssiponensis), and evaluated how these effects scaled-up at the population and assemblage levels. Results. With increasing levels of desiccation stress, limpets showed significant lower levels of total glutathione, tended to grow less and had reduced per capita interaction strength on their resources. Discussion. Results suggested that phenotypic plasticity (i.e., reduction in adults' body size) allowed buffering biochemical responses to stress to scale-up at the assemblage level. Unveiling the linkages among different levels of biological organization is key to develop indicators that can anticipate large-scale ecological impacts of climate change.","2016-10-20","2019-02-08 16:24:01","2019-03-31 19:53:00","","e2533","","","4","","PeerJ","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","WOS:000385821100004","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/Y5QT3AS4/Maggi et al. - 2016 - Climate-related environmental stress in intertidal.pdf","","coastal; heat; drought; ecology; adaptation; Antioxidant   mechanisms; Ecological scaling; evolutionary; Extreme climatic events; impacts; Interaction   strength; invertebrates; phenotypic plasticity; Phenotypic plasticity; Rocky intertidal gastropod; shifts; shores; systems; variance; downloaded by Rachel; downloaded by Alex; excluded - experimental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

H.","A review of the importance of freshwater inflow to the future conservation of Lake St Lucia","Aquatic Conservation-Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems","","1052-7613","10.1002/aqc.1061","","1. Lake St Lucia, the oldest formally protected estuary in the world is under threat from historic and present manipulation of freshwater supplies to the system. 2. Constraints to the functioning of the ecosystem began in 1914 with the commencement of draining and canalization of the Mfolozi Swamp to open up the swamp and river floodplain for sugar cane cultivation. Warner's Drain was completed in 1936 and the sediment filtering capability of the swamp on river floodwaters was effectively removed. This resulted in exceptionally high sediment loads from the Mfolozi River entering directly into the St Lucia system and the river was therefore diverted southwards and provided with a separate estuary mouth. This deprived St Lucia of its single largest freshwater supply. 3. During the past 50-60 years, increasing freshwater abstractions from the Mkhuze, Mzinene, Hluhluwe and Nyalazi rivers have contributed to the increasingly severe salinity extremes experienced by Lake St Lucia. In the past decade, desiccation of large areas of False Bay, North and South Lake has occurred, due primarily to natural estuary mouth closure combined with a prolonged drought and unnaturally low freshwater inflows during the closed phase. These events have pushed the system into an extreme state that has not been recorded previously and would not have occurred if Mfolozi River water had been available to the St Lucia system over this drought period. 4. Forestry plantations have further exacerbated the freshwater supply situation, although recent removal of pine plantations on the eastern and western shores of the lake are likely to help restore groundwater flows to the system. 5. This review explores the possibility of relinking the Mfolozi River, once the Mfolozi floodplain swamp has been re-established, to the St Lucia system, thereby bringing urgently needed fresh water to this threatened World Heritage Site.

This study investigated the relationship between environmental variables and marine turtle stranding. The environmental variables examined in this study, in descending order of importance, were freshwater discharge, monthly mean maximum and minimum air temperatures, monthly average daily diurnal air temperature difference and rainfall for the latitudinal hotspots (-27 degrees, -25 degrees, -23 degrees, -19 degrees) along the Queensland coast as well as for major embayments within these blocks. This study found that marine turtle strandings can be linked to these environmental variables at different lag times (3-12 months), and that cumulative (months added together for maximum lag) and non-cumulative (single month only) effects cause different responses. Different latitudes also showed different responses of marine turtle strandings, both in response direction and timing. Cumulative effects of freshwater discharge in all latitudes resulted in increased strandings 10-12 months later. For latitudes -27 degrees, -25 degrees and -23 degrees non-cumulative effects for discharge resulted in increased strandings 7-12 months later. Latitude - 19 degrees had different results for the non-cumulative bay with strandings reported earlier (3-6 months). Monthly mean maximum and minimum air temperatures, monthly average daily diurnal air temperature difference and rainfall had varying results for each examined latitude. This study will allow first responders and resource managers to be better equipped to deal with increased marine turtle stranding rates following extreme weather events.","2017-08-03","2019-02-08 16:24:01","2019-04-20 15:05:10","","e0182548","","8","12","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","WOS:000406853600139","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/K2PV5EHK/Flint et al. - 2017 - The impact of environmental factors on marine turt.pdf","","coastal; freshwater; heat; downloaded by Lillian; drought; ecology; variability; temperature; australia; climate events; conservation; dugongs; extreme; hervey-bay; queensland; seagrass; downloaded by Rachel; marine; storm; downloaded by Brandon; downloaded by Jenna; fresh; downloaded by Alex; excluded - modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Laboratory studies have cataloged the range of responses to flow and sediment movement that allow benthos to survive, and even to thrive, under intense, storm-driven sediment movement. Extreme sedimentation events also result from man’s modifications of the nearshore marine environment, and the scale and magnitude of these alterations can often greatly exceed that of natural occurrences. Unfortunately, there is little of the quantitative information necessary for predicting how materials placement, sediment deposition and erosion will affect the ecology of these environments. We are using both field and laboratory approaches in Delaware Bay to address two questions. First, what rates and frequencies of sediment movement characterize natural events, and second, what rates and frequencies are detrimental to representative benthic species and functional groups. We present these results as case studies that address ecological impacts of dredge materials placement, site selection and benthic community responses. Quantifying natural sedimentation rates and the susceptibility of macrofauna by functional groups are both critical to reliably predicting environmental impacts. If biological effects are parameterized appropriately (i.e. in terms of natural processes), it may be possible to employ the existing knowledge-base of benthic ecology to predict effects of disturbances and to design projects that will minimize these impacts. Materials placement that is analogous to natural events should allow community responses to follow natural seasonal and successional trends and to exhibit minimal anthropogenic impacts. When sedimentation exceeds natural thresholds, then impacts may involve total loss of the community and subsequent colonization by pioneer species. In this latter case, an entirely different suite of ecological processes will drive impacts and recovery, potentially leading to dramatically altered benthic communities. Understanding organisms’ sublethal responses and drawing on experimental ecological studies will lead to improved prediction of benthic community responses and more reliable assessment of project impacts. # 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In recent decades, the frequency and intensity of daily precipitation extremes have suffered from an increment in many parts of the world, including Central and Eastern Europe. Wet spells are deﬁned by the number of consecutive rainy days with different thresholds. The identiﬁcation of wet spells and their trends in the rainfall time is very important for many sectors, such as agriculture, ecology, hydrology and water resources. Wet spells can lead to extreme events and cause ﬂoods and other disasters. In this study, we will attempt to characterise global precipitation in the context of wet spells and associated precipitation depth of wet spells in the Danube River Basin area using daily precipitation data, as well as analysing different approaches to identifying wet spells. The ten most intense wet spells were detected, and the most intense, which occurred on 23 September 1996, was studied in depth in terms of precipitation and associated anomalies, the synoptic situation and the anomalous transport of moisture using a Lagrangian approach. The existence of a marked west-east dipole in the ﬁeld of sea level pressure between the Atlantic Ocean and the eastern Mediterranean leads to the anomalous moisture transport from the Northern Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea, where a higher available amount of moisture existed, and subsequently penetrated within the low positioned over the Danube River Basin. In addition, an Atmospheric River was also responsible for the wet conditions in the Danube River Basin. The combination of all these factors was responsible for the extreme precipitation linked with the wet spell.","2017-08-17","2019-02-10 01:20:22","2019-04-20 14:17:49","2019-02-10 00:43:15","615","","8","9","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/Z9QNPUQT/Ciric et al. - 2017 - Wet Spells and Associated Moisture Sources Anomali.pdf","","freshwater; downloaded by Rachel; marine; storm; downloaded by Brandon; excluded - not about ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we explore the ecology of nannoplankton during the PETM by using multivariate analyses of a global data set that is based upon the distribution of taxa in time and space. We use these results, coupled with stable isotope data and geochemical modeling, to reinterpret the ecology of key genera. The results of the multivariate analyses suggest that the community was perturbed significantly in coastal and high-latitudes sites compared to the open ocean, and the relative influence of temperature and nutrient availability on the assemblage varies regionally. The open ocean became more stratified and less productive during the PETM and the oligotrophic assemblage responded primarily to changes in nutrient availability. Alternatively, assemblages at the equator and in the Southern Ocean responded to temperature more than to nutrient reduction. In addition, the assemblage change at the PETM was not merely transient—there is evidence of adaptation and a long-term change in the nannoplankton community that persists after the PETM and results in the disappearance of a high-latitude assemblage. The long-term effect on communities caused by transient warming during the PETM has implications for modern-day climate change, suggesting similar permanent changes to nannoplankton community structure as the oceans warm.","2013","2019-02-12 05:19:50","2019-03-26 00:54:55","2019-02-12 05:19:50","628-647","","04","39","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/6Y29P6N4/Schneider et al. - 2013 - Calcareous nannoplankton ecology and community cha.pdf","","freshwater; downloaded by Lillian; temperature; excluded - paleo, not modern extreme event","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the spatial and temporal complexity of the shoreline's thermal environment challenges ecologists' ability to progress from site-speciﬁc measurements to general predictions. In this study, we conducted intensive ﬁeld experiments to quantify inter-individual variation in body temperature among organisms and surrogate organisms at a typical intertidal site, and we used these measurements to characterize micro-scale variation in potential thermal stress. Within the 336-m extent of our site, local variation was substantial in several metrics of extreme and cumulative thermal exposure. The within-site variation in extreme temperatures rivaled (and in some cases greatly exceeded) variation among sites along 14° of latitude (1660 km of Paciﬁc shoreline). Application of our within-site data to a simple theory of risk suggests that small-scale spatial variation in temperature can reduce the chance of local extirpation that otherwise would accompany an increase in average habitat temperature or an increase in the frequency of extreme thermal events. The magnitude of this “buffering” effect also depends heavily on inter-individual variation in thermal tolerance, a factor that has received relatively little attention from physiologists. We hope that by highlighting the important role of within-site variability (both of temperature and tolerance) in the persistence of intertidal populations, this study will foster further research into the biophysical, physiological, behavioral, and genetic interactions underlying ecological dynamics on wave-washed shores.","2011-04","2019-02-12 17:51:30","2019-04-20 14:48:16","2019-02-12 17:51:30","175-190","","1-2","400","","","Spreading the risk","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/522GZCW3/Denny et al. - 2011 - Spreading the risk Small-scale body temperature v.pdf","","coastal; heat; temperature; marine; downloaded by Brandon; downloaded by Alex; exclude - not extreme event","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the study of Recent benthic foraminiferal distribution on the Ayeyarwaddy Delta Shelf off Myanmar, the occurrence of the species Asterorotalia trispinosa was very conspicuous. Though many previous workers have reported the occurrence of the species A. trispinosa as a major constituent in foraminiferal assemblages from different regions, its ecological signiﬁcance has never been studied before. The present work on the surface distribution of A. trispinosa species in the study area, establishes its preference for low salinity. The ecological preferences of A. trispinosa make the species a useful proxy for the delineation of wet and dry periods of the past. The downcore variation in the abundances of A. trispinosa, its reproductive behaviour viz. its MPS and stable isotopic values were analysed, in sediments of the core GC-5 collected at 37 m water depth on the delta front. Downcore variations in the abundance and MPS of A. trispinosa indicate two signiﬁcant climatic conditions in the study area since 1513 AD; a dry climate prior to 1650 AD and warm and wet climate since 1650 to present. They also reveal that since 1650, 3 major freshwater pulses are recorded in the core at ~1675, 1750 and 1850 AD. The multi-proxy data also support these ﬁndings. This high-resolution palaeoclimatic data representing the past 489 years, may be the Asian signatures of the European Little Ice Age.

We critically evaluated the adaptive capacity and ultimately the resilience to decadal changes in temperature and rainfall of the polychaete assemblages.

We found a signiﬁcant upward trend in temperature during the last four decades at all marine ecoregions of Brazil, while rainfall increase was restricted to the SE Brazil ecoregion. Benthic assemblages and climate trends varied signiﬁcantly among and within ecoregions.

Finally, water emergency dispatch, water demand compression and water diversion were proposed to cope with the generalized drought risk.","2014-09","2019-02-12 23:40:33","2019-03-27 01:20:26","2019-02-12 23:40:33","259-276","","2","73","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/UKY9F9RH/Yan et al. - 2014 - Theoretical framework of generalized watershed dro.pdf","","drought; downloaded by Jenna; fresh; exclude- theoretical framework, not raw data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Flow influences in-stream communities through changes in water velocity, depth, temperature, turbidity and nutrient fluxes, and perturbations in the organisation of lower trophic levels are cascaded through the food web, resulting in shifts in food availability for consumer species. River birds are sensitive to spatial and phenological mismatches with aquatic prey following flow disturbances; however, the role of flow as a determinant of riparian ecological structure remains poorly known. This knowledge is crucial to help to predict if, and how, riparian communities will be influenced by climate-induced changes in river flow characterised by more extreme high (i.e. flood) and/or low (i.e. drought) flow events. Here, we combine national-scale datasets of river bird surveys and river flow archives to understand how hydrological disturbance has affected the distribution of riparian species at higher trophic levels. Data were analysed for 71 river locations using a Generalized Additive Model framework and a model averaging procedure. Species had complex but biologically interpretable associations with hydrological indices, with species’ responses consistent with their ecology, indicating that hydrological-disturbance has implications for higher trophic levels in riparian food webs. Our quantitative analysis of river flow-bird relationships demonstrates the potential vulnerability of riparian species to the impacts of changing flow variability and represents an important contribution in helping to understand how bird communities might respond to a climate change-induced increase in the intensity of floods and droughts. Moreover, the success in relating parameters of river flow variability to species’ distributions highlights the need to include river flow data in climate change impact models of species’ distributions.","2013-12-10","2019-02-12 23:43:00","2019-03-26 00:53:42","2019-02-12 23:43:00","e83221","","12","8","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/ZQFBQXMI/Royan et al. - 2013 - Avian Community Responses to Variability in River .pdf","","freshwater; downloaded by Lillian; drought; temperature; storm; downloaded by Brandon; downloaded by Jenna; fresh; excluded - modeling","","Iwata, Tomoya","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Any long-term change in the hydrological regime will impact the ecology. Analysis of long-term water level hydrographs, using a methodology prescribed for surface water flow gauging data, provides a set of ecohydrological ‘indicators of alteration’. These indicators collectively form a robust quantified measure of change that provides a basis for assessing the ecological impact that may result from a changed hydrological regime. This method was tested using monthly frequency water level data from three west coast UK coastal dunes, over periods of up to 37 years. Mean hydrological variables derived from the hydrographs were compared pre-impact and post-impact for a variety of perturbations: medium-term climate variation and pre-shoreline and post-shoreline erosion. The method provided a valid quantification of hydrological change. The low frequency of water-level data measurements compared with continuous flow-gauge data precluded analysis of change in inter-annual variability or perturbation (coefficients of variability) because of the likelihood of missed extreme flood and drought. Principal components analysis was used to identify associations between hydrological indicators and highlighted redundancy among some indicators such as measures of frequency and duration but orthogonality, i.e. independence, of others such as mean water levels and duration of drought. The hydrological effects of climatic variation over a 37-year period, of management interventions and erosion events that occurred at the three coastal dunes were small compared with the likely impact from projected climate change predictions.

Oligosaline lakes are common in arctic regions where evaporation surpasses precipitation, however these extreme microbial communities are poorly characterized. Many oligosaline lakes, in contrast to freshwater ones, experience annual blooms of haptophyte algae that generate valuable alkenone biomarker records that can be used for paleoclimate reconstruction. These haptophyte algae are globally important, and globally distributed, aquatic phototrophs yet their presence in microbial molecular surveys is scarce. To target haptophytes in a molecular survey, we compared microbial community structure during two haptophyte bloom events in an arctic oligosaline lake, Lake BrayaSø in southwestern Greenland, using high-throughput pyrotag sequencing. Our comparison of two annual bloom events yielded surprisingly low taxon overlap, only 13% for bacterial and 26% for eukaryotic communities, which indicates signiﬁcant annual variation in the underlying microbial populations. Both the bacterial and eukaryotic communities strongly resembled high-altitude and high latitude freshwater environments. In spite of high alkenone concentrations in the water column, and corresponding high haptophyte rRNA gene copy numbers, haptophyte pyrotag sequences were not the most abundant eukaryotic tag, suggesting that sequencing biases obscured relative abundance data. With over 170 haptophyte tag sequences, we observed only one haptophyte algal Operational Taxonomic Unit, a prerequisite for accurate paleoclimate reconstruction from the lake sediments. Our study is the ﬁrst to examine microbial diversity in a Greenland lake using next generation sequencing and the ﬁrst to target an extreme haptophyte bloom event. Our results provide a context for future explorations of aquatic ecology in the warming arctic.","2012","2019-02-13 00:14:25","2019-03-27 01:07:59","2019-02-13 00:14:25","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/G756T5G8/Theroux et al. - 2012 - Comparative Molecular Microbial Ecology of the Spr.pdf","","freshwater; downloaded by Lillian; temperature; storm; downloaded by Brandon; exclude - not extreme event","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A key issue is how managing riverine flows to meet human water needs will affect the viability of species that are federally listed as threatened or endangered, including the Gulf of Mexico sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi. Our present understanding of Gulf sturgeon ecology within the Apalachicola River basin indicates that altered riverine flow regimes may affect spawning success and possibly the recruitment patterns of the population. Through intensive field work, we documented Gulf sturgeon spawning site selection in the Apalachicola River and then evaluated the relationship between river stage and the available spawning habitat at these sites. We then used an age-structured simulation model to assess the effects of changes in recruitment patterns on population viability using hypothetical scenarios based on changes in flow regime and its effect on available spawning habitat. Over 3 years we were able to collect almost 500 Gulf sturgeon eggs in the Apalachicola River at three different spawning sites. We observed that the depths and flows where eggs were found were similar across years and sites despite varying river conditions. River discharges of less than 142 m3/s at Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam significantly reduced the spawning habitat available to Gulf sturgeon at all known spawning sites, potentially affecting recruitment. Gulf sturgeon populations are probably sensitive to changes in recruitment, and if extreme low-flow events occur with increasing frequency owing to water management policy choices or climatic events, population recovery could be impaired and the risk of extirpation could increase. Managers should consider the potential effects on Gulf sturgeon recruitment when determining future flow regime policies within the ACF.","2009","2019-02-13 00:15:33","2019-04-20 15:11:05","2019-02-13 00:15:33","1266-1284","","6","138","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/WHESPPSK/Flowers et al. - 2009 - Spawning Site Selection and Potential Implications.pdf; /Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/I4SI45YV/T08-144.html","","drought; downloaded by Jenna; fresh; excluded - modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We demonstrate how such variations depend on changes in hydrological conditions driven by land use, meteorological variations and potential changes in climate with important implications on mitigation strategies, water ecology and utilization of water resources. Quality of river water discharging into the Larsmo-Öja Lake in Midwestern Finland was studied by using long term water data collected during 1963–2009. Acid sulfate soils are extremely acidic soils (pH < 4) that are known to discharge very large amounts of acidity and metals into recipient water courses, and this was also evident in the study area where extreme acidic events have occurred frequently. Looking at the whole study period, there was an abrupt and consistent decline in pH in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the main river (Esse River) that coincided with extensive drainage works that dropped the ground water level, enabling oxidation of sulﬁdic soils and transport of acidity to the rivers. Since then, there is a trend of decreasing acidic events and rising pH values, probably due to a continuous depletion of the acidic pool in the existing a.s. soils. In the short run, water quality varied greatly due to varying hydrological conditions between seasons and years. Generally, the impact from a.s. soils was highest during high runoff in autumn and spring, and therefore, neutralization of acidity in discharge water by liming would at such occasions be very demanding. The relationship between the runoff and water quality was, however, somewhat different during different seasons. As expected, dry summers (low ground water levels) were found to increase the impact from a.s. soils in the subsequent autumn, but only if runoff was high. Towards the end of the study period winters tended to become warmer with higher runoff and spring ﬂoods tended to occur earlier. Thus, events with bad water quality during the winter months have become more common and acidic spring surges occur earlier. Seen from the data in this study, it is obvious that potential changes in the future climate will have signiﬁcant consequences on the impact from a.s. soils on water courses.","2013-04","2019-02-13 00:17:51","2019-03-27 01:10:00","2019-02-13 00:17:51","60-69","","","487","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/KC7AW67A/Toivonen et al. - 2013 - Hydrological processes behind annual and decadal-s.pdf","","freshwater; downloaded by Lillian; temperature; storm; downloaded by Brandon; excluded - long-term trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used long-­term tag–recapture data to investigate and estimate within-­and among-p­opulation differences in vital rates, life histories, and population dynamics of marble trout Salmo marmoratus, an endemic freshwater salmonid with a narrow range. Only ten populations of pure marble trout persist in headwaters of Alpine rivers in western Slovenia. Marble trout populations are also threatened by floods and landslides, which have already caused the extinction of two populations in recent years. We estimated and determined causes of variation in growth, survival, and recruitment both within and among populations, and evaluated trade-o­ffs between them. Specifically, we estimated the responses of these traits to variation in water temperature, density, sex, early life conditions, and extreme events. We found that the effects of population density on traits were mostly limited to the early stages of life and that growth trajectories were established early in life. We found no clear effects of water temperature on vital rates. Population density varied over time, with flash floods and debris flows causing massive mortalities (>55% decrease in survival with respect to years with no floods) and threatening population persistence. Apart from flood events, variation in population density within streams was largely determined by variation in recruitment, with survival of older fish being relatively constant over time within populations, but substantially different among populations. Marble trout show a fast to slow continuum of life histories, with slow growth associated with higher survival at the population level, possibly determined by food conditions and age at maturity. Our work provides unprecedented insight into the causes of variation in vital rates, life histories, and population dynamics in an endemic species that is teetering on the edge of extinction.","2016-10","2019-02-13 00:22:47","2019-03-27 01:11:10","2019-02-13 00:22:47","2086-2102","","7","26","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/TNDPQP4G/Vincenzi et al. - 2016 - Within- and among-population variation in vital ra.pdf","","freshwater; downloaded by Lillian; temperature; storm; downloaded by Brandon; excluded - long-term trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address these issues we utilized three watersheds characterized by similar shape, geology, soils, vegetation cover, and land use arranged across a 900mm gradient in mean annual rainfall (MAR). Using this space-for-time design, we quantified suspended sediment (SS) and particulate organic carbon (POC) export over 18months to examine how large-scale climate trends (MAR) affect sediment supply and delivery patterns (hysteresis) in tropical watersheds. Average daily SS yield ranged from 0.128 to 0.618tkm−2 while average daily POC ranged from 0.002 to 0.018tkm−2. For the largest storm events, we found that sediment delivery exhibited similar clockwise hysteresis patterns among the watersheds, with no significant differences in the similarity function between watershed pairs, indicating that: (1) in-stream and near-stream sediment sources drive sediment flux; and (2) the shape and timing of hysteresis is not affected by MAR. With declining MAR, the ratio of runoff to baseflow and inter-storm length between pulse events both increased. Despite increases in daily rainfall and the number of days with large rainfall events increasing with MAR, there was a decline in daily SS yield possibly due to the exhaustion of sediment supply by frequent runoff events in high MAR watersheds. By contrast, mean daily POC yield increased with increasing MAR, possibly as a result of increased soil organic matter decomposition, greater biomass, or increased carbon availability in higher MAR watersheds. We compared results to modeled values using the Load Estimator (LOADEST) FORTRAN model, confirming the negative relationship between MAR and sediment yield. However, because of its dependency on mean daily flow, LOADEST tended to under predict sediment yield, a result of its poor ability to capture the high variability in tropical streamflow. Taken together, results indicate that declines in MAR can have contrasting effects on hydrological processes in tropical watersheds, with consequences for instream ecology, downstream water users, and nearshore habitat.","2018-04-01","2019-02-13 14:12:06","2019-03-27 01:06:27","2019-02-13 14:12:06","28-39","","","306","","Geomorphology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/UI42J98W/Strauch et al. - 2018 - Influence of declining mean annual rainfall on the.pdf","","freshwater; storm; downloaded by Brandon; excluded - long-term trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To assess how benthic fauna respond to these specific hydraulic conditions, we investigated the relationships between flow regime, hydraulic conditions (boundary Reynolds number, Re*), and macroinvertebrate communities (taxon richness and abundance) in a tropical glacier-fed stream located in the high Ecuadorian Andes (> 4000 m). Both physical and biotic variables were measured under four discharge conditions (base-flow and glacial flood pulses of various intensities), at 30 random points, in two sites whose hydraulic conditions were representative to those found in other streams of the study catchment. While daily glacial flood pulses significantly increased hydraulic stress in the benthic habitats (appearance of Re* > 2000), low stress areas still persisted even during extreme flood events (Re* < 500). In contrast to previous research in temperate glacier-fed streams, taxon richness and abundance were not significantly affected by changes in hydraulic conditions induced by daily glacial flood pulses. However, we found that a few rare taxa, in particular rare ones, preferentially occurred in highly stressed hydraulic habitats. Monte-Carlo simulations of benthic communities under glacial flood reduction scenarios predicted that taxon richness would be significantly reduced by the loss of high hydraulic stress habitats following glacier shrinking. This pioneer study on the relationship between hydraulic conditions and benthic diversity in an equatorial glacial stream evidenced unknown effects of climate change on singular yet endangered aquatic systems.

During the 3-year time period of 1993–1995, it has been observed that the devastating conditions of low DO levels in the Love River frequently appear at a certain time after the emergence of peak rainfall. While the official investigation with regard to estuarine and river ecology indicates that more than 85 fish species could be found in the neighbouring river systems in South Taiwan, only 17 fish species appeared in the estuarine system of the Love River. To integrate the knowledge of environmental and ecological impacts in these extreme storm events, a two-dimensional numerical model – Love River Hydrodynamic and Water Quality model (LRHWQ) – was developed to simulate the fate and transport of contaminants in the Love River estuarine system. It eventually produces the responsive information of water quality and the dissolved oxygen deficit with respect to the combined sewer overflow (CSO) impacts along the river corridor. To justify the impact of DO level on the fish community, a laboratory analysis was conducted with respect to the living threshold of young Liza macrolepis and Chanos chanos that are two representative fish species in the group of abundant species in the Love River. The LC50 found in this study lies in between 0.8–1.1 mg/L; yet the saturated oxygen concentration is normally near 9.0 mg/L in the study area. The fish community is sensitive to the dissolved oxygen deficit and simulation studies confirm that simply building a sewage interceptor system to handle routine wastewater effluents without regard to the CSO issues in the storm events cannot fulfil the ultimate goal of environmental restoration in this urban river system.","2004-03-01","2019-02-13 15:42:22","2019-04-20 14:06:33","2019-02-13 15:42:22","33-49","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/XNZWII3L/Chen et al. - 2004 - Assessing the stormwater impact to an urban river .pdf","","coastal; freshwater; storm; downloaded by Brandon; downloaded by Alex; excluded - modeling","Water quality; Combined sewage overflow; Ecological impact assessment; Environmental restoration; Simulation model; Urban river system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ecosystem of the St. Lucie Estuary ͑SLE͒, located on the east coast of south Florida, has been greatly inﬂuenced by development of an intricate network of storm-water drainage canals in the tributary watershed. A suite of models dealing with watershed hydrology, reservoir optimization, and estuary salinity and ecology are applied for optimal sizing and operation of storm-water reservoirs. The multipurpose storm-water control facilities provide for hydrologic restoration to predrained or natural hydrologic conditions for recovery of salinitysensitive biota in the SLE, as well as supplemental irrigation water and pollution control through connected storm-water treatment areas. The optimization is challenging since the ecological goal is for mean monthly storm-water discharges to the SLE to coincide with the desired natural frequency distribution, rather than simply attempting to control individual extreme events. The OPTI6 optimization model applies a genetic algorithm, coupled with a daily simulation model of the storm-water drainage network, to optimize the sizing and fuzzy operating rules of reservoirs for controlling storm-water discharges to the SLE. Results indicate that the desired frequency distribution is closely matched and the level of service for the supplemental irrigation demand is met under reduced storage requirements.","2006-09","2019-02-14 16:20:07","2019-03-27 01:15:33","2019-02-14 16:20:07","320-329","","5","132","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/ATUN3A7J/Wan et al. - 2006 - Optimization of Frequency Distribution of Storm-Wa.pdf","","coastal; storm; downloaded by Alex; exclude- human stressor, but no extreme climate event","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Six mass-balanced models were developed using the “Ecopath with Ecosim” software package to assess changes in benthic food web properties in the Mondego estuarine ecosystem (Portugal). Field, laboratory and literature information were used to construct the models. The main study objective was to assess at 2 sites (a Zostera meadow and a bare sediment area) the effects of: (1) a period of anthropogenic enrichment, which led to excessive production of organic matter in the form of algal blooms (1993/1994); (2) the implementation of mitigation measures, following a long period of eutrophication (1999/2000); and (3) a centenary ﬂood (winter 2000/2001). Different numbers of compartments were identiﬁed at each site and in each time period. In general, the Zostera site, due to its complex community, showed a higher number of compartments and a higher level of system activity (i.e. sum of consumptions, respiration, ﬂow to detritus, production, total system throughput, net primary production and system omnivory index). The differences at the two sites in the three time periods in the breakdown of throughput were mainly due to differences in the biomass of the primary producers (higher primary production at the Zostera site). Consumption, respiration and ﬂow to detritus were dominated by the grazers Hydrobia ulvae and Scrobicularia plana at the Zostera and bare sediment sites respectively. At both sites, after recovery measures were implemented there was an increase in S. plana and Hediste diversicolor biomass, consumption, respiration and ﬂows to detritus, and a decrease in H. ulvae biomass and associated ﬂows, which increased again after the ﬂood event. The mass-balanced models showed that the trophic structure of the benthic communities in Mondego estuary was affected differently by each disturbance event. Interestingly, in our study a high system throughput seems to be associated with higher stress levels, which contradicts the idea that higher system activity is always a sign of healthier conditions.","2011-03","2019-02-14 16:20:14","2019-04-17 12:56:45","2019-02-14 16:20:14","1209-1221","","6","222","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/IGJ2ENAP/Baeta et al. - 2011 - Modelling the effects of eutrophication, mitigatio.pdf","","coastal; storm; downloaded by Alex; exclude - mass balance model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ecology would therefore beneﬁt from the ability to predict the frequency and severity of extreme environmental events. Some extreme events (e.g., earthquakes) are simple events: either they happen or they don’t, and they are generally difﬁcult to predict. In contrast, extreme ecological events are often compound events, resulting from the chance coincidence of run-of-the-mill factors. Here we present an environmental bootstrap method for resampling short-term environmental data (rolling the environmental dice) to calculate an ensemble of hypothetical time series that embodies how the physical environment could potentially play out differently. We use this ensemble in conjunction with mechanistic models of physiological processes to analyze the biological consequences of environmental extremes. Our resampling method provides details of these consequences that would be difﬁcult to obtain otherwise, and our methodology can be applied to a wide variety of ecological systems. Here, we apply this approach to calculate return times for extreme hydrodynamic and thermal events on intertidal rocky shores. Our results demonstrate that the co-occurrence of normal events can indeed lead to environmental extremes, and that these extremes can cause disturbance. For example, the limpet Lottia gigantea and the mussel Mytilus californianus are co-dominant competitors for space on wave-swept rocky shores, but their response to extreme environmental events differ. Limpet mortality can vary drastically through time. Average yearly maximum body temperature of L. gigantea on horizontal surfaces is low, sufﬁcient to kill fewer than 5% of individuals, but on rare occasions environmental factors align by chance to induce temperatures sufﬁcient to kill .99% of limpets. In contrast, mussels do not exhibit large temporal variation in the physical disturbance caused by breaking waves, and this difference in the pattern of disturbance may have ecological consequences for these competing species. The effect of environmental extremes is under added scrutiny as the frequency of extreme events increases in response to anthropogenically forced climate change. Our method can be used to discriminate between chance events and those caused by long-term shifts in climate.","2009-08","2019-02-14 15:22:06","2019-04-20 14:54:51","2019-02-14 15:22:06","397-421","","3","79","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/EPGBY8W5/Denny et al. - 2009 - On the prediction of extreme ecological events.pdf","","coastal; heat; downloaded by Alex; excluded - modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These changes may affect demography and life history traits of macrofaunal species. We evaluated the role of climate in explaining variations in population traits of the mole crab Emerita brasiliensis over 20 yr on a sandy beach in Uruguay, based on a set of predictive hypotheses recently developed from studies of beach and climate-change ecology. Population abundance increased with sea surface temperature (SST), reproductive and recruitment periods were more extended, and recruitment was higher during warm years, when population structure showed a multi-modal structure. Decreasing asymptotic sizes and increasing growth rates were also observed concurrently with increasing SST. La Niña events, which in coastal Uruguayan waters are characterized by a higher influence of tropical oceanic waters (warm and salty), had marked positive impacts on abundance and individual growth. In a climate change scenario, an increasing frequency of extreme La Niña events is expected and therefore our results have strong implications. In a space-for-time substitution context, our long-term trends are reinforced by macroscale results that reported an increase in growth rates and in reproduction and recruitment periods, together with a decrease in female individual sizes, from temperate to tropical beaches of the Atlantic coast of South America. Spacefor-time substitution is highlighted as an alternative approach to analyze potential population changes resulting from climate change in these data-poor ecosystems.","2016-06-23","2019-02-14 15:20:19","2019-04-17 13:10:19","2019-02-14 15:20:19","211-222","","","552","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/3V63TKZ5/Celentano and Defeo - 2016 - Effects of climate on the mole crab Emerita brasil.pdf","","coastal; heat; downloaded by Alex; exclude - not extreme event","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This ﬁsh, captured by Humans since the Holocene, is nowadays heavily exploited and its population has decreased substantially since the mid-1990s. The uncertainty associated to jack mackerel population structure currently hampers management. Several hypotheses have been proposed from a single population up to several discrete populations. Still no deﬁnitive answer was given. Determining how environmental conditions drive jack mackerel distribution can provide insights on its population structure. To do so, here we performed in three steps. First, we used satellite data to develop a statistical model of jack mackerel horizontal habitat suitability. Model predictions based on interaction between temperature and chlorophyll-a match the observed jack mackerel distribution, even during extreme El Niño event. Second, we studied the impact of oxygen and show that jack mackerel distribution and abundance is correlated to oxygen over a wide variety of scales and avoid low oxygen areas and periods. Third, on the basis of the above we built a conceptual 3D model of jack mackerel habitat in the Southeastern Paciﬁc. We reveal the presence of a low suitable habitat along the Chilean and Peruvian coast, ﬁguratively presenting a closed door caused by a gap in the horizontal habitat at $19–22°S and a shallow oxycline off south-centre Peru. This kind of situation likely occurs on a seasonal basis, in austral summer but also at longer temporal scales. A lack of exchanges at some periods/seasons partially isolate jack mackerel distributed off Peru. On the other hand the continuity in the habitat during most of the year explains why exchanges occur. We conclude that the more likely population structure for jack mackerel is a pelagic metapopulation.","2016-08","2019-02-14 15:20:12","2019-04-17 13:05:44","2019-02-14 15:20:12","199-211","","","146","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/HZ5C5VTY/Bertrand et al. - 2016 - 3-D habitat suitability of jack mackerel Trachurus.pdf","","coastal; heat; temperature; marine; downloaded by Brandon; downloaded by Alex; exclude - not extreme event","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a comprehensive understanding of the influence of deterministic drivers and stochastic environmental variations favouring population renewal processes has remained elusive. This study quantifies the deterministic and stochastic components of environmental change that lead to outbreaks of the jellyfish Pelagia noctiluca in the Mediterranen Sea. Using data of jellyfish abundance collected at 241 sites along the Catalan coast from 2007 to 2010 we: (1) tested hypotheses about the influence of time-varying and spatial predictors of jellyfish outbreaks; (2) evaluated the relative importance of stochastic vs. deterministic forcing of outbreaks through the environmental bootstrap method; and (3) quantified return times of extreme events. Outbreaks were common in May and June and less likely in other summer months, which resulted in a negative relationship between outbreaks and SST. Cross- and along-shore advection by geostrophic flow were important concentrating forces of jellyfish, but most outbreaks occurred in the proximity of two canyons in the northern part of the study area. This result supported the recent hypothesis that canyons can funnel P. noctiluca blooms towards shore during upwelling. This can be a general, yet unappreciated mechanism leading to outbreaks of holoplanktonic jellyfish species. The environmental bootstrap indicated that stochastic environmental fluctuations have negligible effects on return times of outbreaks. Our analysis emphasized the importance of deterministic processes leading to jellyfish outbreaks compared to the stochastic component of environmental variation. A better understanding of how environmental drivers affect demographic and population processes in jellyfish species will increase the ability to anticipate jellyfish outbreaks in the future.","2015-10-20","2019-02-14 15:20:23","2019-04-17 12:58:57","2019-02-14 15:20:23","e0141060","","10","10","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/HAZJHXRC/Benedetti-Cecchi et al. - 2015 - Deterministic Factors Overwhelm Stochastic Environ.PDF","","coastal; heat; downloaded by Alex; exclude - not extreme event","","Molinero, Juan Carlos","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
