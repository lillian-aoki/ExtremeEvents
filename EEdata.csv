No specific extreme event is considered, but the effect of several extreme precipitation events are considered on moss population stability. Moreover, only erosion was correlated to the occurrence of extreme precipitation; thus I only extracted data on erosion, not for moss","I agree this study was ambiguous -- I might change actual extreme event from Y to N. Extreme events were described as > 4cm precipitation within 24 hours and the frequency of such rain events was compared for two locations. While this is a numerical definition, I don't feel like it is a staistical definition, which I would see more as something like ""extreme events are more rain in 24 hours than 99% of rain events"" or ""greater than 2 standard deviations above average"" or something like that ... ? I also think that the moss coverage should be added as the biological response (they also measure species composition but did not relate it to other variables?)- The stream with higher frequency of ""extreme"" rain events suffered significantly more losses of moss plots than the stream with less rain (would classify effect as small-sig). They measured other parameters (soil texture, soil pH, soil electrical conductivity, bank slope, %canopy cover, and leaf cover) for each plot at each visit, while sites were different in regards to several of these, only erosion was related to moss loss.",57,N,Y,Earthquake,,Volcanic submarine activity/hydrothermal gas release,months,>1000 sq m,undefined,38.637687,15.109844,Europe,Italy,112002,coastal ocean,Southern Tyrrhenian Sea,92006,none,single sample,none,N,<1 sq m,Y,>1000 sq m,Yes with a statistical context-specific definition,,carbon assimilation,submerged aquatic vegetation,primary producers,non-directional change,large - sig,sig,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"changed from coastal veg-grasses to submerged aquatic vegetation- seagrass is an SAV, I think coastal veg-grasses are for terrestrial grasses?",57,N,Y,Earthquake,,Volcanic submarine activity/hydrothermal gas release,months,>1000 sq m,undefined,38.637687,15.109844,Europe,Italy,112002,coastal ocean,Southern Tyrrhenian Sea,92006,none,single sample,none,N,<1 sq m,Y,>1000 sq m,Yes with a statistical context-specific definition,,growth,submerged aquatic vegetation,primary producers,decrease,large - sig,sig,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,58,Y,Y,Drought,,Drought,years,Regional/Continent,years,51.30451,1.209951,Europe,United Kingdom,11992,catchment/watershed,Little Stour Creek,91992,years,single sample,years,Y,1-10 sq m,Y,>1000 sq m,No - extreme event mentioned but not defined,,abundance,invertebrates,multiple trophic levels,decrease,extreme - sig,sig,N,water,streamflow,discharge,decrease,large - sig not tested,no response,N,,,,,,,,"Month not indicated for several of the parameters - only instered years, but could be changed to 01YYYY if easier for analysis.",,58,Y,Y,Drought,,Drought,years,Regional/Continent,years,51.30451,1.209951,Europe,United Kingdom,11992,catchment/watershed,Little Stour Creek,91992,years,single sample,years,Y,1-10 sq m,Y,>1000 sq m,No - extreme event mentioned but not defined,,abundance,invertebrates,detritivores,decrease,extreme - sig,sig,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,58,Y,Y,Drought,,Drought,years,Regional/Continent,years,51.30451,1.209951,Europe,United Kingdom,11992,catchment/watershed,Little Stour Creek,91992,years,single sample,years,Y,1-10 sq m,Y,>1000 sq m,No - extreme event mentioned but not defined,,taxonomic diversity,invertebrates,multiple trophic levels,increase,extreme - sig,sig,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,58,Y,Y,Drought,,Drought,years,Regional/Continent,years,51.30451,1.209951,Europe,United Kingdom,11992,catchment/watershed,Little Stour Creek,91992,years,single sample,years,Y,1-10 sq m,Y,>1000 sq m,No - extreme event mentioned but not defined,,taxonomic community structure,invertebrates,multiple trophic levels,multidirectional,unspecified/unclear,no response,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,59,Y,,Weather System,,Dessication,weeks,,undefined,32.62972222,34.91944444,Europe,Israel,,marine intertidal,Dor-HaBonim Beach,92012,months,weeks,months,Y,1-10 sq m,Y,100-1000 sq m,Yes with a non-statistical general definition,,percent cover,algae-macro,primary producers,decrease,extreme - sig,sig,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The extreme event is really prolongued dessication, driven by strong, dry wind and warm temperatures.
