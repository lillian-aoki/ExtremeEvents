This genus contains several potentially pathogenic species, including Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio alginolyticus. These bacteria have short generation times, as low as 20-30 min, and can thus respond rapidly to changing environmental conditions. A five-parameter mechanistic model was generated based on environmental processes including hydrodynamics, growth, and death rates of Vibrio bacteria to predict total Vibrio abundance in the Neuse River Estuary of eastern North Carolina. Additionally an improved statistical model was developed using the easily monitored parameters of temperature and salinity. This updated model includes data that covers more than eight years of constant bacterial monitoring, and incorporates extreme weather events such as droughts, storms, and floods. These models can be used to identify days in which bacterial abundance might coincide with increased health risks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We tested whether episodic exposure to elevated body temperatures that are possible in future climate scenarios leads to up-regulation of the antioxidant defense system or, alternatively, to accumulation of oxidative damage. We quantified antioxidant capacities against peroxyl and hydroxyl radicals, catalase enzymatic activity, and lipid peroxidation-a form of oxidative damage-in gill, mantle, and adductor muscle from mussels (Mytilus californianus) exposed to three treatments for 4 weeks: immersed continuously in seawater (15 +/- 1 degrees C), exposed to moderate temperature air (21.8 +/- 0.1 degrees C) for 4 h per day, or exposed to warm air (30 +/- 0.1 degrees C) for 4 h per day. We quantified antioxidants and oxidative damage under both baseline conditions and following a common, acute heat stress challenge. Gill tissue accumulated lipid peroxidation damage during the acute thermal challenge independent of acclimation history, and this tissue expressed the lowest baseline levels of defense against peroxyl radicals that promote lipid peroxidation. There was no up-regulation of measured components of the antioxidant system in any tissue following the acclimation regimes. There was also no evidence for chronic accumulation of lipid oxidative damage. Based on these patterns, we hypothesize that the costs of repairing lipid peroxidation are less than the costs of mounting a constitutive, baseline antioxidant defense against extreme events that tend to be rare and relatively unpredictable in nature.","2016-03","2019-02-08 16:24:01","2019-03-18 17:07:54","","","","3","163","","Mar.

The effects of these stressors on intertidal organisms are often associated with their shape and size. Rocky intertidal shores in Patagonia are particularly stressful environments in which a species of false limpet occurs abundantly in 2 contrasting habitats. Here we describe size and shape segregation of the false limpet Siphonaria lessonii across multiple shores on 2 contrasting shore levels where limpets are abundant, namely the high (HT) and mid (MT) intertidal. We tested for differences in resistance to desiccation, and recovery from heat stress, and were able to define 2 ecomorphs using classic and geometric morphometrics analysis. Individuals from the HT lost significantly less water under stressful heat conditions, and showed higher recovery rates than those from the MT. Limpets from the HT had a broad aperture, flatter margin and larger size. In contrast, individuals from the MT had a narrow aperture, arched margin and smaller size. Together these results suggest the existence of 2 ecomorphs modulated by each contrasting habitat. The observed small-scale spatial segregation of the 2 ecomorphs may provide ecological advantages by allowing the exploitation of resources from 2 different habitats. The 2 ecomorphs may provide S. lessonii with a broad thermal tolerance breadth, potentially improving resistance of the species to extreme climatic events.","2018-11-15","2019-02-08 16:24:01","2019-03-18 17:29:40","","55-63","","","606","","Mar.

T.","Influences of large-scale climatic variability on episodic tree mortality in northern Patagonia","Ecology","","0012-9658","","","In the context of potential-global warming, it is critical that ecologists bridge the typically local spatial scale of ecology to the regional scale of climatology by linking ecosystem responses to variations in the large-scale synoptic controls of regional climates. In northern Patagonia, Argentina, we related regional-scale tree mortality events over the past similar to 100 years to annual and decadal-scale climatic variations associated with changes in the major synoptic climatic controls of the southeastern Pacific region, including the El Ni (n) over tilde o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In nine stands of Austrocedrus chilensis, a xeric conifer, we used dendrochronological techniques to date the outermost tree ring on dead-standing and fallen trees to estimate the dates of tree death for 336 trees. To evaluate climatic conditions during periods of high tree mortality, we used regional records of precipitation and temperature from six climate stations and also used a regional set of 24 tree ring chronologies from Austrocedrus. Good preservation of the resinous wood of Austrocedrus allowed relatively precise dating of tree deaths over the past similar to 90 years. Episodes of massive tree mortality coincide with exceptionally dry springs and summers during the 1910s, 1942-1943, and the; 1950s. Although there is a general regional synchroneity of tree death associated with drought, intra-regional variations in the intensity of droughts, as interpolated and mapped from the regional network of tree ring chronologies, are also reflected by north-to-south variations in tree mortality patterns. Periods of drought and associated tree mortality during the 20th century in northern Patagonia are strongly associated with above average sea level atmospheric pressure off the coast of Chile at the same latitudes. Temperature and precipitation in northern Patagonia are highly influenced by the intensity and latitudinal position of the southeastern Pacific anticyclone, which, in turn, are greatly affected by ENSO. Tree mortality in northern Patagonia appears to be intensified by extreme events of the Southern Oscillation and is more strongly coincident with El Ni (n) over tilde o events along the coast of northern Peru. These results, in combination with previously established climatic influences on fire occurrence and tree seedling establishment, strongly link stand-level and regional-scale forest dynamic processes in northern Patagonia with variations in large-scale atmospheric conditions.","1998-12","2019-02-08 16:24:01","2019-03-13 02:08:52","","2624-2640","","8","79","","Ecology","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","WOS:000077501000005","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/BWI7SKCH/Villalba and Veblen - 1998 - INFLUENCES OF LARGE-SCALE CLIMATIC VARIABILITY ON .pdf","","coastal; heat; drought; patterns; dynamics; argentina; Austrocedrus chilensis; chile; climatic variability; dendrochronology; El Nino Southern Oscillation; fire; forest dynamics; forest-steppe ecotone; hemisphere; northern Patagonia; rain-forest; regeneration; southern oscillation; tree   mortality; downloaded by Rachel; storm; downloaded by Alex; excluded because not aquatic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Estuarine waters at the interface of marine and freshwater bodies are among the most volatile ecosystems, particularly for aquatic species, and will be strongly inﬂuenced by the temperature with extreme ﬂooding events. This study aimed to quantify the acclimation capacity of coastal ﬁsh species to estuarine plume modiﬁcations. The thicklip mullet (Chelon labrosus) and European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were selected as representative species of estuarine ecological guilds. These ﬁsh were subjected to an experiment mimicking a brief freshwater intrusion (35e5). These experiments were conducted at two different temperatures that these two species would encounter during their incursion from the sea through estuarine waters to freshwater habitats. The experimental results conﬁrmed the high capacity for acclimation of both species to changes in salinity and temperature. Interspeciﬁc differences were observed. For example, the salinity has a greater effect on the metabolism of the seabass than on that of the mullets. Meanwhile, the temperature has a greater effect on the mullets. These differences in metabolic responses to ﬂuctuating salinities and temperatures may modify the use of estuarine waters by these species and should be considered when predicting future speciﬁc distribution areas in the context of global change.","2016-05","2019-02-10 01:20:22","2019-03-13 02:02:01","2019-02-10 00:43:12","9-15","","","173","","","Difference in responses of two coastal species to fluctuating salinities and temperatures","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/BTNS7S9Y/Trancart et al. - 2016 - Difference in responses of two coastal species to .pdf","","coastal; freshwater; heat; downloaded by Lillian; temperature; downloaded by Rachel; marine; storm; downloaded by Brandon; downloaded by Alex; excluded because experimental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we examined the relationship of two components of the microplankton community (acritarchs and radiolarians) to volcanic ash deposits in two deepwater sections from South China (Shangsi and Xinmin). In these sections, each eruptive event was recorded as a volcanic couplet consisting of a pale, 0.1 to 3.0-cm-thick bentonite (altered volcanic ash) overlain by a dark, 0.1- to 1.0-cm-thick, organic-rich mudstone layer. Acritarchs were found in peak abundance in the mudstone overlying each ash layer but were otherwise present only in low concentrations in the background sediment. In contrast, radiolarians were rare in the volcanic couplets but frequently abundant in the background intervals. The thickest volcanic ash layers in both sections are found immediately below and above the latest Permian mass extinction (LPME) horizon. At this level, radiolarians underwent a major regional extinction but acritarchs reached their peak abundance, confirming their role as a disaster taxon. Above the LPME, long-spined and small spherical acritarchs declined more rapidly than short-spined forms. The preference of the short-spined acritarchs for neritic inner-shelf facies may indicate that such areas served as biotic refugia during intervals of extreme environmental stress. We infer that volcanic eruptions during the Permian–Triassic transition had both positive effects (e.g., increased nutrient supply) and negative effects (e.g., metal toxicity, lowered seawater pH, increased turbidity) on marine microplankton communities, the importance of which varied both spatially and temporally.","2013-09-20","2019-02-10 01:20:22","2019-03-11 23:37:04","2019-02-10 00:42:58","552-567","","8","28","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/YQS5SVL8/Shen et al. - 2013 - VOLCANIC EFFECTS ON MICROPLANKTON DURING THE PERMI.pdf","","downloaded by Rachel; marine; storm; excluded - paleo, not modern extreme event","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Anticipated climate-change trends for southern Florida include increased weather uncertainty with more droughts, higher temperatures, and an increased number of more intense storms. Hydrologic regimes, temperature, and CO2 have been strongly correlated with plant community structure, coral and fish abundance and diversity, and higher trophic-level responses.

Sea-level rise is expected to be 0.8 to 2 m over the next century, a serious problem in a landscape that rises only 5 cm/km from Florida Bay inland. Wading birds and other wildlife species dependent on fresh water are likely to decline because of salt-water overwash and inundation. In addition to causing habitat loss, saltwater inundation of the peat substrate of Everglades freshwater wetlands may increase C emissions from sequestered C released as peat is destroyed and freshwater plant communities die.

El Niño-related extreme weather conditions can have a significant impact on vector- and water-borne diseases. The linkages between weather, terrestrial ecology and human health have been discovered for some diseases, such as rodentborne hantavirus. Marine ecology also plays a role in determining human health risks, such as from cholera, and other enteric pathogens. Deforestation and ensuing changes in landuse, human settlement, commercial development, road construction, and water control systems singly, and in combination have been accompanied by increases in or emergence of diseases like malaria and schistosomiasis in some regions of the world. Long-term climate change may increase the frequency of heat waves and potentially air pollution episodes, increase the number of extreme weather events, cause coastal flooding and salination of fresh water aquifers, and displace coastal settlements.

Atmospheric model simulations show that warm air from upper levels was brought down towards the surface over Signy Island in a föhn wind generated by northerly flow over Coronation Island, a mountainous island just to the north of Signy Island. Modelled temperatures over Signy Island are in good agreement with observations and thus support the hypothesis that the record temperature was caused by a combination of exceptional warm advection with conditions suitable for the generation of föhn.

Although Rift Valley fever outbreaks have been known to follow periods of above-normal rainfall, the timing of the outbreak events has largely been unknown. Similarly, there is inadequate knowledge on climate drivers of chikungunya outbreaks. We analyze a variety of climate and satellite-derived vegetation measurements to explain the coupling between patterns of climate variability and disease outbreaks of Rift Valley fever and chikungunya. Methods and Findings: We derived a teleconnections map by correlating long-term monthly global precipitation data with the NINO3.4 sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly index. This map identifies regional hot-spots where rainfall variability may have an influence on the ecology of vector borne disease. Among the regions are Eastern and Southern Africa where outbreaks of chikungunya and Rift Valley fever occurred 2004–2009. Chikungunya and Rift Valley fever case locations were mapped to corresponding climate data anomalies to understand associations between specific anomaly patterns in ecological and climate variables and disease outbreak patterns through space and time. From these maps we explored associations among Rift Valley fever disease occurrence locations and cumulative rainfall and vegetation index anomalies. We illustrated the time lag between the driving climate conditions and the timing of the first case of Rift Valley fever. Results showed that reported outbreaks of Rift Valley fever occurred after ,3–4 months of sustained above-normal rainfall and associated green-up in vegetation, conditions ideal for Rift Valley fever mosquito vectors. For chikungunya we explored associations among surface air temperature, precipitation anomalies, and chikungunya outbreak locations. We found that chikungunya outbreaks occurred under conditions of anomalously high temperatures and drought over Eastern Africa. However, in Southeast Asia, chikungunya outbreaks were negatively correlated (p,0.05) with drought conditions, but positively correlated with warmer-than-normal temperatures and rainfall. Conclusions/Significance: Extremes in climate conditions forced by the El Nin˜o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) lead to severe droughts or floods, ideal ecological conditions for disease vectors to emerge, and may result in epizootics and epidemics of Rift Valley fever and chikungunya. However, the immune status of livestock (Rift Valley fever) and human (chikungunya) populations is a factor that is largely unknown but very likely plays a role in the spatial-temporal patterns of these disease outbreaks. As the frequency and severity of extremes in climate increase, the potential for globalization of vectors and disease is likely to accelerate. Understanding the underlying patterns of global and regional climate variability and their impacts on ecological drivers of vector-borne diseases is critical in long-range planning of appropriate disease and diseasevector response, control, and mitigation strategies.","2012-01-24","2019-02-10 01:20:22","2019-03-11 17:25:12","2019-02-10 00:42:53","e1465","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/AA2ELPU8/Anyamba et al. - 2012 - Climate Teleconnections and Recent Patterns of Hum.PDF","","downloaded by Lillian; drought; temperature; downloaded by Rachel; marine; storm; downloaded by Brandon; excluded because terrestrial, human disease","","Zhou, Xiao-Nong","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Impact of climate change on ecology, economy and society – the three pillars of sustainability – is increasing.

Proposals of the geoengineering for iron fertilization of oceans or manipulation of solar flux using stratospheric scatters are yet not feasible for scientific and environmental reasons. Forests as carbon sinks, therefore, are re- quired to play a multifunctional role that includes, but is not limited to, biodiversity conservation and maintenance of ecosystem functions; yield of goods and services to the society; enhancing the carbon storage in trees, woody vegetation and soils; and pro- viding social and economic well-being of people.

In this paper, we examine mechanisms by which climate change can affect various ecological factors that are likely to drive an increase in the overall incidence as well as the frequency of outbreaks of leptospirosis. We will discuss the geographical areas that are most likely to be at risk of an increase in leptospirosis disease burden owing to the coexistence of climate change hazard risk, environmental drivers of leptospirosis outbreaks, local socioeconomic circumstances, and social and demographic trends. To reduce this disease burden, enhanced surveillance and further research is required to understand the environmental drivers of infection, to build capacity in emergency response and to promote community adaptation to a changing climate.","2010-10","2019-02-10 01:20:22","2019-03-18 17:24:16","2019-02-10 00:42:49","631-638","","10","104","","","Climate change, flooding, urbanisation and leptospirosis","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/898QH3HM/Lau et al. - 2010 - Climate change, flooding, urbanisation and leptosp.pdf","","downloaded by Rachel; marine; storm; excluded - review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If current trends continue, mean ocean pH is expected to decrease by ~0.2 units over the next ~50 years. Yet, there is also substantial temporal variability in pH and other carbon system parameters in the ocean resulting in regions that already experience change that exceeds long-term projected trends in pH. This points to short-term dynamics as an important layer of complexity on top of long-term trends. Thus, in order to predict future climate change impacts, there is a critical need to characterize the natural range and dynamics of the marine carbonate system and the mechanisms responsible for observed variability. Here, we present pH and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) at time intervals spanning 1 hour to >1 year from a dynamic, coastal, temperate marine system (Beaufort Inlet, Beaufort NC USA) to characterize the carbonate system at multiple time scales. Daily and seasonal variation of the carbonate system is largely driven by temperature, alkalinity and the balance between primary production and respiration, but high frequency change (hours to days) is further influenced by water mass movement (e.g. tides) and stochastic events (e.g. storms). Both annual (~0.3 units) and diurnal (~0.1 units) variability in coastal ocean acidity are similar in magnitude to 50 year projections of ocean acidity associated with increasing atmospheric CO2. The environmental variables driving these changes highlight the importance of characterizing the complete carbonate system rather than just pH. Short-term dynamics of ocean carbon parameters may already exert significant pressure on some coastal marine ecosystems with implications for ecology, biogeochemistry and evolution and this shorter term variability layers additive effects and complexity, including extreme values, on top of long-term trends in ocean acidification.","2013-12-17","2019-02-10 01:20:22","2019-03-18 17:09:42","2019-02-10 00:43:04","e85117","","12","8","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/QDTTKBSX/Johnson et al. - 2013 - Dramatic Variability of the Carbonate System at a .PDF; /Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/N325FQ8V/article.html","","coastal; freshwater; heat; downloaded by Lillian; temperature; downloaded by Rachel; marine; storm; downloaded by Brandon; downloaded by Alex; excluded - not extreme event","","Thiyagarajan (Rajan), Vengatesen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To study the factors associated with subnivium development, we quantiﬁed three critical phenophases of the subnivium: establishment, maintenance, and disintegration along a latitudinal and land cover gradient in the Great Lakes Region of North America. We hypothesized that subnivium phenophases would depend primarily on snow depth and air temperature, but that these would be mediated by latitude and land cover. We found that patterns in both establishment and disintegration were affected by latitude more than land cover, but that variability in the timing of early season snowfall events overrode the effects of both factors in subnivium establishment. In contrast, disintegration was predictably later in more northerly sites, regardless of interannual variation in weather patterns. We found that the subnivium was the result of a balance between ambient temperature, snow depth, and snow density, but that ambient temperatures constrained the system by contributing to the frequency of snowfall and inducing changes in snow depth and density. Areas in lake effect zones, characterized by high snow depths and persistent snow cover, may be the last refugia for subnivia-dependent species given the predicted shifting climate regimes of the 21st century.","2018-06-01","2019-02-12 05:31:09","2019-03-13 01:37:24","2019-02-12 05:31:09","064037","","6","13","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/IHVVCYL4/Thompson et al. - 2018 - The phenology of the subnivium.pdf","","freshwater; downloaded by Lillian; temperature; excluded because not aquatic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We combined statistical (spectral analysis and Machine learning techniques) and physically based models to generate, for the ﬁrst time in this system, a predictive tool of phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll-a) and composition (morphology-based functional groups). The results, based on a 11-year time series, revealed two alternating phases in the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton biomass. One phase is characterized by high inorganic turbidity and low phytoplankton biomass, and the other by low inorganic turbidity and variable (low and high) phytoplankton biomass. A threshold of turbidity (29 TNU), above which phytoplankton remains with low biomass (<15–20 ug/l) was established. The periods of high turbidity, which in total cover 30% of the time series, start abruptly and are related to external forcing. Meteorological conditions associated with the beginning of these periods were modeled through a regression tree analysis. These conditions consist of moderate to high wind intensities from the SW direction, in some cases combined with high antecedent precipitation or low water level. The results from the physically-based modeling indicated that the long decaying time-scale of turbidity and intermediate resuspension events could explain the prolonged length of the high turbidity periods (∼1.5 years). Random Forests models for the prediction of phytoplankton biomass and composition in periods of low turbidity resulted in a proportion of explained variance and a classiﬁcation error over a test sample of 0.46 and 0.34 respectively. Turbidity, conductivity, temperature and water level were within the most important model predictors. The development and improvement of this type of modeling is needed to provide management tools to water managers in the current water supply situation.","2017-09","2019-02-12 05:37:33","2019-03-15 14:02:41","2019-02-12 05:37:33","80-93","","","360","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/7IAUNZCF/Crisci et al. - 2017 - Multi-model approach to predict phytoplankton biom.pdf","","freshwater; downloaded by Lillian; temperature; storm; downloaded by Brandon; excluded - modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Subarctic freshwaters are sentinels for understanding both stressors because the effects of climate change are disproportionately strong at high latitudes and invasion of temperate species is prevalent. Here, we summarize the environmental effects of climate change and illustrate the ecological responses of freshwater fishes to these effects, spanning individual, population, community and ecosystem levels. Climate change is modifying hydrological cycles across atmospheric, terrestrial and aquatic components of subarctic ecosystems, causing increases in ambient water temperature and nutrient availability. These changes affect the individual behavior, habitat use, growth and metabolism, alter population spawning and recruitment dynamics, leading to changes in species abundance and distribution, modify food web structure, trophic interactions and energy flow within communities and change the sources, quantity and quality of energy and nutrients in ecosystems. Increases in temperature and its variability in aquatic environments underpin many ecological responses; however, altered hydrological regimes, increasing nutrient inputs and shortened ice cover are also important drivers of climate change effects and likely contribute to context-­dependent responses. Species invasions are a complex aspect of the ecology of climate change because the phenomena of invasion are both an effect and a driver of the ecological consequences of climate change. Using subarctic freshwaters as an example, we illustrate how climate change can alter three distinct aspects of species invasions: (1) the vulnerability of ecosystems to be invaded, (2) the potential for species to spread and invade new habitats, and (3) the subsequent ecological effects of invaders. We identify three fundamental knowledge gaps focused on the need to determine (1) how environmental and landscape characteristics influence the ecological impact of climate change, (2) the separate and combined effects of climate and non-n­ ative invading species and (3) the underlying ecological processes or mechanisms responsible for changes in patterns of biodiversity.","2017-06","2019-02-12 05:44:47","2019-03-11 23:20:39","2019-02-12 05:44:47","4109-4128","","12","7","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/Q67WP4JF/Rolls et al. - 2017 - Conceptualising the interactive effects of climate.pdf","","freshwater; downloaded by Lillian; temperature; excluded - review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents the results of the 2011–2012 winter ﬁeld campaign in streams and rivers near Quebec City, QC, Canada. The objective was to quantify water quantity and quality parameters and their environmental connectivity from headwater creeks above to the larger rivers below over the entire freeze-up, mid-winter and breakup periods with a view toward exploring the watershed continuum. The paper presents how aquatic pulses (water level, discharge, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen and turbidity, measured at seven sites on an hourly basis along channels of different sizes and orders) evolve through the aquatic environment. Ice conditions and the areal ice coverage were also evaluated (on a daily time step along each instrumented channel). Some ﬁndings of the investigation revealed that water temperatures remained well above 0 ◦C during winter in headwater channels, that dissolved oxygen levels during winter were relatively high, but with severe depletions prior to and during breakup in speciﬁc settings, that high conductivity spikes occurred during runoff events, that annual turbidity extremes were measured in the presence of ice and that dynamic ice cover breakup events have the potential to generate direct or indirect mortality among aquatic species and to dislodge the largest rocks in the channel. The authors believe that the environmental impact of a number of winter ﬂuvial processes needs to be further investigated, and the relative signiﬁcance of the winter period in the annual environmental cycle should be given additional attention.","2017-05-09","2019-02-12 05:46:22","2019-03-13 02:04:23","2019-02-12 05:46:22","337","","5","9","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/PCVHREBC/Turcotte and Morse - 2017 - The Winter Environmental Continuum of Two Watershe.pdf","","freshwater; downloaded by Lillian; temperature; excluded because not extreme event","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We designed a long-­term (8 months) mesocosm experiment to explore how ambient water temperature (C: control), induced increased temperature (T: +4°C), and temperature fluctuations (F: ±4°C relative to T) change phytoplankton phenology, taxonomical diversity, and community structure, and how such changes affected zooplankton abundance and composition. Synthesis. Our results show that T and F relative to C significantly decreased phytoplankton diversity. Moreover, there was a clear effect of the temperature treatments (T and F) on phytoplankton size structure that resulted in a significantly lower growth of large species (i.e., large Chlorophyta) compared to C. Decreased diversity and evenness in the T and F treatments pushed the community toward the dominance of only a few phytoplankton taxa (mainly Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta) that are better adapted to endure warmer and more irregular temperature conditions. The observed shift toward Cyanobacteria dominance may affect trophic energy transfer along the aquatic food web.","2017-05","2019-02-12 05:47:45","2019-03-11 23:17:47","2019-02-12 05:47:45","2936-2946","","9","7","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/DEJQ6FX8/Rasconi et al. - 2017 - Temperature increase and fluctuation induce phytop.pdf","","freshwater; downloaded by Lillian; temperature; marine; downloaded by Brandon; excluded - experimental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we characterize genetic and plastic responses to temperature increase in the aquatic keystone grazer Daphnia magna combining a candidate gene and an outlier analysis approach. We capitalize on the short generation time of our species, facilitating experimental evolution, and the production of dormant eggs enabling the analysis of long-term response to environmental change through a resurrection ecology approach. We quantify plasticity in the expression of 35 candidate genes in D. magna populations resurrected from a lake that experienced changes in average temperature over the past century and from experimental populations differing in thermal tolerance isolated from a selection experiment. By measuring expression in multiple genotypes from each of these populations in control and heat treatments, we assess plastic responses to extreme temperature events. By measuring evolutionary changes in gene expression between warm- and cold-adapted populations, we assess evolutionary response to temperature changes.

Especially, desert dust storms can transport alien microorganisms over continental scales and can deposit them in sensitive sink habitats. In winter 2014, the largest ever recorded Saharan dust event in Italy was efficiently deposited on the Dolomite Alps and was sealed between dust-free snow. This provided us the unique opportunity to overcome difficulties in separating dust associated from “domestic” microbes and thus, to determine with high precision microorganisms transported exclusively by desert dust. Results: Our metagenomic analysis revealed that sandstorms can move not only fractions but rather large parts of entire microbial communities far away from their area of origin and that this microbiota contains several of the most stress-resistant organisms on Earth, including highly destructive fungal and bacterial pathogens. In particular, we provide first evidence that winter-occurring dust depositions can favor a rapid microbial contamination of sensitive sink habitats after snowmelt. Conclusions: Airborne microbial depositions accompanying extreme meteorological events represent a realistic threat for ecosystem and public health. Therefore, monitoring the spread and persistence of storm-travelling alien microbes is a priority while considering future trajectories of climatic anomalies as well as anthropogenically driven changes in land use in the source regions.","2017-12","2019-02-12 05:51:29","2019-03-13 02:17:46","2019-02-12 05:51:29","","","1","5","","","Legal immigrants","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/PEV8295U/Weil et al. - 2017 - Legal immigrants invasion of alien microbial comm.pdf","","freshwater; downloaded by Lillian; temperature; storm; downloaded by Brandon; excluded because not aquatic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In spite of the increasing appreciation of jellyfish as an important component in marine ecosystem, there are still considerable gaps in understanding how the phase transition from the benthic polyp to the pelagic medusa stage is influenced by multiple environmental factors, including nutrition. To investigate survival, growth, and phase transition of Aurelia aurita polyps, we designed a factorial experiment manipulating food quantity (20μg C, 5μg C and 1.5μg C polyp−1 every other day), food quality (Artemia salina and two dietary manipulated Acartia tonsa), and temperature (13°C, 20°C, and 27°C). Temperature was the key factor determining phase transition of polyps and negatively affecting their survival rate and growth at 27°C, which reflected a summer heatwave scenario. Furthermore, at polyps' optimum tolerance temperature (20°C) in our study, budding reproduction benefits from high food concentrations. Interestingly, polyps fed with food containing high level highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) were able to compensate for physiological stress caused by the extreme temperature, and could enhance budding reproduction at optimum temperature. Moreover, benthic-pelagic coupling (strobilation) was determined by temperature but affected significantly by food conditions. Mild temperature together with optimum food conditions contributes to inducing more polyps, which may potentially bring about great ephyrae recruitments during overwintering. In contrast, heatwave events can potentially regulate plankton community structure accompanied by changes of nutritional conditions of primary and secondary producers and thus, negatively affect the population dynamics of polyps. We suggest a novel polyp tolerance curve, which can help to understand jellyfish population dynamics in different seasons and ecosystems. This sets up a baseline for understanding how anticipated global warming and food conditions may affect the population size of benthic polyps and consequently pelagic medusae.","2019-03-15","2019-02-12 17:05:57","2019-03-15 13:44:05","2019-02-12 17:05:56","1280-1288","","","656","","Science of The Total Environment","Food quality matters","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/MPZX7BR2/Chi et al. - 2019 - Food quality matters Interplay among food quality.pdf","","temperature; marine; downloaded by Brandon; excluded - experimental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2015 large parts of Europe were affected by drought. In this paper, we analyze the hydrological footprint (dynamic development over space and time) of the drought of 2015 in terms of both severity (magnitude) and spatial extent and compare it to the extreme drought of 2003. Analyses are based on a range of low flow and hydrological drought indices derived for about 800 streamflow records across Europe, collected in a community effort based on a common protocol. We compare the hydrological footprints of both events with the meteorological footprints, in order to learn from similarities and differences of both perspectives and to draw conclusions for drought management. The region affected by hydrological drought in 2015 differed somewhat from the drought of 2003, with its center located more towards eastern Europe. In terms of low flow magnitude, a region surrounding the Czech Republic was the most affected, with summer low flows that exhibited return intervals of 100 years and more. In terms of deficit volumes, the geographical center of the event was in southern Germany, where the drought lasted a particularly long time. A detailed spatial and temporal assessment of the 2015 event showed that the particular behavior in these regions was partly a result of diverging wetness preconditions in the studied catchments. Extreme droughts emerged where preconditions were particularly dry. In regions with wet preconditions, low flow events developed later and tended to be less severe. For both the 2003 and 2015 events, the onset of the hydrological drought was well correlated with the lowest flow recorded during the event (low flow magnitude), pointing towards a potential for early warning of the severity of streamflow drought. Time series of monthly drought indices (both streamflow- and climate-based indices) showed that meteorological and hydrological events developed differently in space and time, both in terms of extent and severity (magnitude). These results emphasize that drought is a hazard which leaves different footprints on the various components of the water cycle at different spatial and temporal scales. The difference in the dynamic development of meteorological and hydrological drought also implies that impacts on various water-use sectors and river ecology cannot be informed by climate indices alone. Thus, an assessment of drought impacts on water resources requires hydrological data in addition to drought indices based solely on climate data. The transboundary scale of the event also suggests that additional efforts need to be undertaken to make timely pan-European hydrological assessments more operational in the future.","2017-06-22","2019-02-12 18:59:52","2019-03-18 17:21:13","2019-02-12 18:59:52","3001-3024","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/ZEFGUE56/Laaha et al. - 2017 - The European 2015 drought from a hydrological pers.pdf","","drought; downloaded by Jenna; fresh; excluded - not about ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Areas that are more vulnerable to such changes are semiarid river systems or regions experiencing intermittent flow and cyclic droughts. Although ecological changes are expected to occur with flow regime alterations, the biological changes cannot be predicted until the flow in such regions is analysed. This study addresses this concern by providing an analysis of flow for a semiarid river basin in the Central Great Plains from a 50 and 100-year projection climate data. The projected data for these two periods are then compared with 30-year historical data to determine changes in flow. Five major components of flow regime, magnitude, duration, and timing of annual extreme water conditions, frequency and duration of high and low pulses, and rate and frequency of water condition changes, were examined with respect to climate change for their impact on the ecology of the basin. This analysis strongly suggests that inter- and intra-annual changes in flow regimes will result in the intensified drying of the basin represented by the increased number of low flow periods followed by higher occurrences of high flow events of shorter duration with expected changes in climate.","2018","2019-02-12 18:55:16","2019-03-11 20:45:27","2019-02-12 18:55:16","195-206","","3","34","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/BR8MAPKD/Chatterjee et al. - 2018 - Projected climate change impacts on hydrologic flo.pdf; /Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/NBNM5IF3/rra.html","","drought; downloaded by Jenna; fresh; excluded because not ecology","GCM; Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration; Kansas; SWAT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim was to provide information on important marine habitats, longterm changes in community structure and the life history (particularly longevity and growth rales) and ecology of species of high nature conservation interest. The benthic studies mainly concentrated on communities of Mediterranean-Atlantic species which are at or near the northern limits of their distribution in the study sites. Many of the species and communities studied are very stable, long-lived and slow recruiting. They are, therefore, also vulnerable to damage. Southern species of cup corals were found to grow slowly and reproduce very infrequently, with populations showing a general decline during the study period. Species of sponges and southern soft corals also typically displayed very slow growth. Periods of above or below average sea water temperature arc considered to be particularly important factors affecting the persistence of Mediterranean-Atlantic species, with higher temperatures linked with recruitment events in scleractinians and unusually cold temperatures appearing to stop growth or even cause contraction in colony size or death in some species, such as certain sponges. The results illustrate the importance of abnormal climate years on species at the geographical limits of their distribution. The extreme stability of these communities of high nature conservation interest has implications for reserve management. Because of their poor capacity for recovery, long-lived and slowly recruiting Mediterranean-Atlantic species are considered to be particularly vulnerable to minor and infrequent damage, which might readily be overlooked in other communities, as well as to more major and widespread damaging events. Monitoring at Lundy and the Isles of Scilly will act as important control sites for monitoring work in the marine environment elsewhere around Britain.","1993-11-11","2019-02-12 18:00:04","2019-03-15 16:25:02","2019-02-12 18:00:04","109-127","","1","172","","Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology","","Changes in Marine Communities","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/2HQ3T3V6/0022098193900923.html","","temperature; marine; downloaded by Brandon; PDF not available; excluded - does not describe extreme event","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Populations came from locations widely differing in their thermal regime, two northern European locations [Ebeltoft (Kattegat), Doverodde (Limfjord, Baltic Sea)], and one southern population from Gabicce Mare (Adriatic Sea), allowing to test for population specificity in the response to a realistic heat stress event. Eelgrass survival and growth as well as the expression of 12 stress associated candidate genes were assessed during and after the heat wave. Contrary to expectations, all populations suffered equally from 3 weeks of heat stress in terms of shoot loss. In contrast, populations markedly differed in multivariate measures of gene expression. While the gene expression profiles converged to pre-stress values directly after the heat wave, stress correlated genes were upregulated again 4 weeks later, in line with the observed delay in shoot loss. Target genes had to be selected based on functional knowledge in terrestrial plants, nevertheless, 10/12 genes were induced relative to the control treatment at least once during the heat wave in the fully marine plant Z. marina.

Here, we review the studies which have used experiments to assess impacts of temperature on marine, freshwater and terrestrial communities, and classify them into a set of ‘generations’ based on how they incorporate variability. The majority of studies have failed to incorporate extreme events. In terrestrial ecosystems in particular, experimental treatments have reduced temperature variability, when most climate models predict increased variability. Marine studies have tended to not concentrate on changes in variability, likely in part because the thermal mass of oceans will moderate variation. In freshwaters, climate change experiments have a much shorter history than in the other ecosystems, and have tended to take a relatively simple approach. We propose a new ‘generation’ of climate change experiments using down-scaled climate models which incorporate predicted changes in climatic variability, and describe a process for generating data which can be applied as experimental climate change treatments.","2013","2019-02-12 17:43:04","2019-03-13 01:42:39","2019-02-12 17:43:04","799-806","","6","16","","","Means and extremes","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/6EUTAUVC/Thompson et al. - 2013 - Means and extremes building variability into comm.pdf","","freshwater; downloaded by Lillian; temperature; marine; downloaded by Brandon; excluded because review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As direct effects of climate change, elevated temperature and ambient CO2 levels have to be taken into account. As indirect effects a large spectrum of impacts ranging from increased stratification of surface water, deoxygenation of subsurface water, increased occurrence of extreme weather events, and a changed food chain and nutrient regime resulting in a changed top down and bottom up control for bacterioplankton. All these direct and indirect effects will affect bacterial communities in a multifaceted way. Changes in the bacterial communities due to climate change impacts can be expected on all different taxonomic levels, i.e. from the clonal intraspecies level to the phylum level. The focus of the article will be on the evaluation of bacterioplankton observations over time and space and along climate gradients in the frame of environmental parameters allowing modelling with respect to climate change scenarios. A specific emphasis will be on bacterioplankton analysis based on analysis of samples of the Continuous Plankton Recorder Archive. This sample archive allowed insights into particle associated bacteria of coastal environments over more than the last 60 years. Beside effects of climate change effectors on bacterial growth and community composition, effects of climate change on bacteria-mediated marine biogeochemical cycling and potential hazards by increased abundance of pathogenic bacteria such as Vibrio cholerae will be considered.","2016","2019-02-12 17:34:54","2019-03-11 20:13:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","Caister Academic Press","Wymondham","English","","","","","Web of Science","","WOS:000388044700003","","","","temperature; marine; downloaded by Brandon; PDF not available; excluded because review, book","","Marxsen, J.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We illustrate these principles with examples of mechanistic approaches ranging from explorations of the ecological niche, random walks, and macrophysiology to theories dealing with scale transition, self-organization, and the prediction of extremes.","2012","2019-02-12 17:49:04","2019-03-15 14:21:23","2019-02-12 17:49:04","1-22","","1","43","","","Scaling Up in Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","Annual Reviews","","","","","","temperature; marine; downloaded by Brandon; PDF not available; excluded - review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We simulated a summer heat wave to investigate how a changing environment affects the interaction between the broadnosed pipefish (Syngnathus typhle) as a host and its digenean trematode parasite (Cryptocotyle lingua). In a fully reciprocal laboratory infection experiment, pipefish from three different coastal locations were exposed to sympatric and allopatric trematode cercariae. In order to examine whether an extreme climatic event disrupts patterns of locally adapted hostparasite combinations we measured the parasite’s transmission success as well as the host’s adaptive and innate immune defence under control and heat wave conditions. Independent of temperature, sympatric cercariae were always more successful than allopatric ones, indicating that parasites are locally adapted to their hosts. Hosts suffered from heat stress as suggested by fewer cells of the adaptive immune system (lymphocytes) compared to the same groups that were kept at 18uC. However, the proportion of the innate immune cells (monocytes) was higher in the 18uC water. Contrary to our expectations, no interaction between host immune defence, parasite infectivity and temperature stress were found, nor did the pattern of local adaptation change due to increased water temperature. Thus, in this host-parasite interaction, the sympatric parasite keeps ahead of the coevolutionary dynamics across sites, even under increasing temperatures as expected under marine global warming.","2012-01-27","2019-02-12 17:48:05","2019-03-18 17:23:32","2019-02-12 17:48:05","e30658","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/Y773V8KS/Landis et al. - 2012 - Consistent Pattern of Local Adaptation during an E.PDF","","coastal; heat; temperature; marine; downloaded by Brandon; downloaded by Alex; excluded - experimental","","Munderloh, Ulrike Gertrud","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the use of these data for near-shore habitats is hindered by the proximity of the coast, therefore further investigation is needed. We compared remote-sensing SST from the MODIS sensor (aboard the Aqua satellite) to near-shore seawater temperature (ST) recorded in situ with data loggers at 5 locations in the western Mediterranean Sea. In situ ST data were collected at 5 m depth over a ~6 yr period and at depths below 5 m at 3 of the locations. We evaluated the suitability of MODIS to represent the temperature at shallow subtidal depths relative to different modes of variability. MODIS reproduced seasonal variability with high correlations (r > 0.98) and biases (0.59 ± 0.03°C) only slightly higher than the accuracy of the loggers (0.50°C). MODIS also captured interannual variability with no systematic biases. When evaluated for intra-seasonal temperature variability, MODIS showed limited biases (up to 0.79°C) with a tendency to overestimate the variability (between 4 and 64%) in both cold and warm seasons. Finally, MODIS over-/underestimated only the most extreme unseasonably cold/warm events (by 1.51 and −0.79°C, respectively). The observed limited differences between the 2 methods can be explained by the particular hydrodynamics of the area and by methodological constraints. Overall, MODIS SST data proved to be a reliable proxy for near-shore ST in the western Mediterranean Sea, and are thus considered suitable for studies requiring temperature reconstruction in shallow near-shore environments.","2016-11-09","2019-02-12 17:32:03","2019-03-11 19:22:20","2019-02-12 17:32:03","21-34","","","559","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/VU2LAL3M/Bernardello et al. - 2016 - A comparison of remote-sensing SST and in situ sea.pdf","","coastal; heat; temperature; marine; downloaded by Brandon; downloaded by Alex; excluded because not ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While field observations on the ecological consequences of heat waves are emerging, experimental evidence is rare, and lacking at the community level. Using a novel “near-natural” outdoor mesocosms approach, this study tested whether marine summer heat waves have detrimental consequences for macrofauna of a temperate coastal community, and whether sequential heat waves provoke an increase or decrease of sensitivity to thermal stress. Three treatments were applied, defined and characterized through a statistical analysis of 15 years of temperature records from the experimental site: (1) no heat wave, (2) two heat waves in June and July followed by a summer heat wave in August and (3) the summer heat wave only. Overall, 50% of the species showed positive, negative or positive/negative responses in either abundance and/or biomass. We highlight four possible ways in which single species responded to either three subsequent heat waves or one summer heat wave: (1) absence of a response (tolerance, 50% of species), (2) negative accumulative effects by three subsequent heat waves (tellinid bivalve), (3) buffering by proceeding heat waves due to acclimation and/or shifts in phenology (spionid polychaete) and (4) an accumulative positive effect by subsequent heat waves (amphipod). The differential responses to single or sequential heat waves at the species level entailed shifts at the community level. Community-level differences between single and triple heat waves were more pronounced than those between regimes with vs. without heat waves. Detritivory was reduced by the single heat wave while suspension feeding was less common in the triple heat wave regime. Critical extreme events occur already today and will occur more frequently in a changing climate, thus, leading to detrimental impacts on coastal marine systems.","2018","2019-02-12 17:19:24","2019-03-11 23:09:28","2019-02-12 17:19:24","4357-4367","","9","24","","","Heat waves and their significance for a temperate benthic community","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/PMQWDZAF/Pansch et al. - 2018 - Heat waves and their significance for a temperate .pdf","","coastal; heat; temperature; marine; downloaded by Brandon; downloaded by Alex; excluded - experimental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Active movements of these nymphs against the water flow were also detected. Large numbers of leptophlebid nymphs reside in floodplains during the winter and spring, but how and why they colonize and develop in temporary habitats is uncertain. We detected few environmental advantages (i.e., temperature, food abundance or quality) for mayflies in floodplains compared with river habitats. Despite this, experiments indicated that mayflies had 36% higher growth rates in the floodplain than in the river and demonstrated tolerance to short-term drying (up to 12 d). Migration entails costs of migrating against flows during daylight when vulnerability to predation is high, colonizing a habitat subject to drying, hypoxia, and supporting amphibian predators, with few apparent benefits. Dispersal into wetlands may be attributed to avoiding swift river flows or exploiting largely fishless habitats. However, dispersal could be an evolutionary relic of behavior beneficial in more northerly habitats; our study populations of Leptophlebia mayflies were at the southern extreme of their range and perhaps operating suboptimally. Our results emphasize the importance of river floodplain linkages to the ecology of both habitats.","2011-08","2019-02-12 22:35:35","2019-03-15 16:32:36","","714-723","","8","89","","Can. J.

Related concerns are underscored by the issue of climate change and the faster warming that is predicted for northern parts of the globe. Advances in knowledge of breakup processes and related topics, achieved over the past 15 years or so, are outlined. They pertain to breakup initiation and ice-jam formation, ice-jam properties and numerical modelling of ice jams, waves generated by ice-jam releases, forecasting and mitigation methods, sediment transport, ecological aspects, and climate-change impacts.

Given that fish persist in these systems under conditions of high environmental variability, dryland rivers represent ideal systems to investigate the processes contributing to and sustaining fish biodiversity and recruitment in variable environments. Hence, spatial and temporal variation in fish assemblage structure was examined in 15 waterholes of the Warrego River between October 2001 and May 2003. Fish assemblages in isolated waterholes were differentiated at the end of the dry 2001 winter but were relatively similar following high summer flows in January 2002 as a consequence of high hydrological connectivity among waterholes. Small, shallow waterholes supported more species and higher abundances than large-deep waterholes. Large, deep waterholes provided important refuge for large-bodied fish species such as adult yellowbelly, Macquaria ambigua, and the eel-tailed catfish, Tandanus tandanus. Recruitment patterns of bony bream (Nematalosa erebi), Hyrtl's tandan (Neosilurus hyrtlii) and yellowbelly were associated with high flow events and backwater inundation; however recruitment of yellowbelly and bony bream was also evident following a zero-flow period. Departures from typical flood-induced seasonal spawning patterns may reflect opportunistic spawning behaviours appropriate to the erratic patterns of flooding and dry spells in dryland rivers.","2006","2019-02-12 22:35:35","2019-03-20 04:42:15","","619-633","","6","57","","Mar.

The stratigraphic history was temporally constrained by radiocarbon dating, whereas the ecology of C4 plants was inferred by stable carbon isotopes from buried soils. Environmental relationships within the Casas Grandes and San Pedro River basins of the Juanaquena study area provide a picture of evolving landscapes where fluvial behavior is driven by climate change and ecosystem instability. Seven periods of flood-plain construction and six episodes of paleosol formation and channel erosion occurred during the last 14,000 C-14 yr B.P. In the latest Pleistocene channel erosion ensued in response to a general warming trend and landscape instability, although C3 plants still dominated in the alluvial valleys. In the Holocene when C4 plants began to dominate, channel erosion was typically initiated by a shift from relatively warmer and drier to cooler and wetter climates. The timing of erosion events exhibits a remarkable correlation to arroyo formation and paleosol formation of ephemeral streams in the North American southwest. In contrast to arroyos, the Casas Grandes and San Pedro Rivers crated flood plains having mixed to bedload meanderbelts that persisted throughout the late Quaternary. However, bedrock valley constrictions accelerated flood-plain building, leading to periodic channel avulsion. Although intervals of landscape instability occurred numerous times in the late Quaternary, fluvial style was largely governed by the dominance of C4 grasslands, which appears to have maintained sufficient upland vegetative cover to mitigate flash flooding typical of and environments.","2003-05","2019-02-12 22:35:35","2019-03-11 22:57:24","","596-606","","5","115","","Geol.

Yet, it is only in the last few decades that concerted efforts have been made to understand and predict ice-jam occurrence and severity. Building on a 1990s state of the art review, new physical knowledge, prediction capabilities, and management methods are discussed herein. The thickness and hydraulic roughness of ice jams have been elucidated, and flow through ice-jam voids quantified. Under-ice transport of frazil ice, which can lead to enormous freezeup accumulations, has been placed on a more rigorous footing, while heat exchange with the water flowing under a jam can be predicted with some confidence. Systematic field measurements have produced new understanding of the waves that are generated by ice-jam releases. Increased understanding of the physical processes has enhanced confidence in older numerical models and motivated development of more sophisticated ones, leading to two-dimensional dynamic algorithms based on continuum as well as discrete element approaches. Ice-jam management and control continue to be difficult tasks, but new structural and non-structural techniques offer promising avenues, at least in the case of relatively small rivers. The emerging issue of climate change and the growing appreciation of related ecological linkages have led to important, but still few, insights on how ice jamming regimes can be modified by altered climatic conditions and what the repercussions might be on river ecology. Despite the progress, there are still major unknowns, particularly related to the conditions of formation and release of ice jams.","2008-01","2019-02-12 22:58:02","2019-03-11 18:45:00","2019-02-12 22:58:02","2-19","","1","51","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/DGMHEC9T/Beltaos - 2008 - Progress in the study and management of river ice .pdf","","freshwater; temperature; storm; downloaded by Brandon; added by Lillian; excluded because review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The endangered Devils Hole Pupﬁsh Cyprinodon diabolis, which is conﬁned to a single warm spring in Death Valley National Park, California–Nevada, has recently experienced record declines, spurring renewed conservation and recovery efforts. In February–December 2010, we investigated the timing and frequency of spawning in the species’ native habitat by using three survey methods: underwater videography, above-water videography, and inperson surveys. Videography methods incorporated ﬁxed-position, solar-powered cameras to record continuous footage of a shallow rock shelf that Devils Hole Pupﬁsh use for spawning. In-person surveys were conducted from a platform placed above the water’s surface. The underwater camera recorded more overall spawning throughout the year (mean § SE D 0.35 § 0.06 events/sample) than the above-water camera (0.11 § 0.03 events/sample). Underwater videography also recorded more peak-season spawning (March: 0.83 § 0.18 events/sample; April: 2.39 § 0.47 events/ sample) than above-water videography (March: 0.21 § 0.10 events/sample; April: 0.9 § 0.32 events/sample). Although the overall number of spawning events per sample did not differ signiﬁcantly between underwater videography and inperson surveys, underwater videography provided a larger data set with much less variability than data from inperson surveys. Fixed videography was more cost efﬁcient than in-person surveys ($1.31 versus $605 per collected data-hour), and underwater videography provided more usable data than above-water videography. Furthermore, video data collection was possible even under adverse conditions, such as the extreme temperatures of the region, and could be maintained successfully with few study site visits.

We researched the effects of large hydroelectric dams on aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages in two Costa Rican rivers. We measured physicochemical characteristics and sampled aquatic macroinvertebrates from March 2003 to March 2004 in two dammed rivers, Peñas Blancas and San Lorenzo, as well as in the undammed Chachagua River. Sites above and below the dam had differences in their physicochemical variables, with wide variation and extreme values in variables measured below the dam in the San Lorenzo River. Sites below the dams had reduced water discharges, velocities, and depths when compared with sites above the dams, as well as higher temperatures and conductivity. Sites above dams were dominated by collector-gatherer-scrapers and habitat groups dominated by swimmer-clingers, while sites below dams had a more even representation of groups. In contrast, a comparison between two sites at different elevation in the undammed river maintained a similar assemblage composition. Tributaries might facilitate macroinvertebrate recovery above the turbine house, but the assemblage below the turbine house resembled the one below the dam. A massive sediment release event from the dam decreased the abundance per sample and macroinvertebrate taxa below the dam in the Peñas Blancas River. Our study illustrates the effects of hydropower production on neotropical rivers, highlighting the importance of using multiple measures of macroinvertebrate assemblage structure for assessing this type of environmental impact.

Climate change is expected to increase the future occurrence of extremes, with potentially devastating effects on rivers and streams. We synthesise knowledge of extremes and their impacts on riverine ecosystems in Australia, a country for which projected changes in event characteristics reflect global trends. Hydrologic extremes play a major structuring role in river ecology across Australia. Droughts alter water quality and reduce habitat availability, driving organisms to refugia. Extreme floods increase hydrological connectivity and trigger booms in productivity, but can also alter channel morphology and cause disturbances such as hypoxic blackwater events. Tropical cyclones and post-cyclonic floods damage riparian vegetation, erode stream banks and alter water quality. Cyclone-induced delivery of large woody debris provides important instream habitat, although the wider ecological consequences of tropical cyclones are uncertain. Wildfires destroy catchment vegetation and expose soils, increasing inputs of fine sediment and nutrients to streams, particularly when followed by heavy rains. Research on the impacts of heat waves and storm surges is scarce, but data on temperature and salinity tolerances, respectively, may provide some insight into ecological responses. We identify research gaps and hypotheses to guide future research on the ecology of extreme climate events in Australia and beyond. A range of phenomenological, experimental and modelling approaches is needed to develop a mechanistic understanding of the ecological impact of extreme events and inform prediction of responses to future change.","2015","2019-02-12 23:32:29","2019-03-18 17:26:46","2019-02-12 23:32:29","2620-2638","","12","60","","","Ecological effects of extreme climatic events on riverine ecosystems","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/FWUPF3UX/Leigh et al. - 2015 - Ecological effects of extreme climatic events on r.pdf","","freshwater; downloaded by Lillian; drought; temperature; storm; downloaded by Brandon; downloaded by Jenna; fresh; excluded - review","climate extremes; river; biota; climate change; ecosystem functioning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present paper we review the various ﬁelds of limnology, such as monitoring, studying highly dynamic processes, lake metabolism studies, and budget calculations, where HFM has been applied, and which have beneﬁtted most from the application. Our meta-analysis showed that more than half of the high-frequency studies from lakes were made in North America and Europe. The main ﬁeld of application has been lake ecology (monitoring, lake metabolism) followed by physical limnology. Water temperature and dissolved oxygen have been the most universal and commonly measured parameters and we review the various study purposes for which these measurements have been used.

The objective of this study was to examine how future changes in precipitation and temperature translate into changes in streamﬂow using a physically based semidistributed model, and subsequently how changes in streamﬂow could potentially impact stream ecology. Streamﬂow parameters were examined in a New York City water supply watershed for changes from model-simulated baseline conditions to future climate scenarios (2081-2100) for ecologically relevant factors of streamﬂow using the Indicators of Hydrologic Alterations tool. Results indicate that earlier snowmelt and reduced snowpack advance the timing and increase the magnitude of discharge in the winter and early spring (November-March) and greatly decrease monthly streamﬂow later in the spring in April. Both the rise and fall rates of the hydrograph will increase resulting in increased ﬂashiness and ﬂow reversals primarily due to increased pulses during winter seasons. These shifts in timing of peak ﬂows, changes in seasonal ﬂow regimes, and changes in the magnitudes of low ﬂow can all inﬂuence aquatic organisms and have the potential to impact stream ecology.","2013-12","2019-02-13 00:08:09","2019-03-11 23:15:14","2019-02-13 00:08:09","1308-1326","","6","49","","","Streamflow Responses to Climate Change","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/3LAEEI5J/Pradhanang et al. - 2013 - Streamflow Responses to Climate Change Analysis o.pdf","","freshwater; downloaded by Lillian; temperature; storm; downloaded by Brandon; excluded - modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research has been undertaken in various fields such as geomorphology, hydrology and many others. In the context of climatic change, there is growing interest in the study of past floods, or palaeofloods. Researchers are attempting to reconstitute the chronology of past floods, especially with respect to past or subrecent climatic changes. The work involves using different methodological approaches borrowed from various disciplines including geology, geomorphology and ecology. The reconstruction of ancient hydrological events such as palaeofloods in fact requires that different methods and techniques be combined in order to trace the chronology of events as precisely as possible using different biophysical parameters. A wide variety of indicators are used in the chronological reconstruction of ancient fluvial environments, whether in humid, subhumid or desert regions. These indicators involve analysing stratigraphic sequences and sedimentary deposits, organic matter and macrorest deposits, as well as using radiocarbon dating (14C), thermoluminescence (TL), and dendrochronology and lichenometry. In fact, most work on the reconstitution of the frequency and magnitude of ancient floods uses several methods and techniques to obtain the long-term chronology of flood events in relation to the specific conditions (e.g., climate, geomorphology) of a region or study area. With the publication of several studies in palaeohydrology, it was interesting to examine, through a literature review, the various approaches used in the study of palaeofloods. This kind of study has seen major advances, which can be explained partly by the interest generated by global climate change and its effect on river-system dynamics.","2004-12","2019-02-13 00:10:23","2019-03-11 23:22:00","2019-02-13 00:10:23","531-543","","4","28","","","Palaeoflood hydrology","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/6F749IEZ/Saint-Laurent - 2004 - Palaeoflood hydrology an emerging science.pdf","","freshwater; downloaded by Lillian; temperature; storm; downloaded by Brandon; excluded - review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, a key characteristic of many laboratory studies is the ability of these terrestrial nematodes to utilize aquatic molluscs as auxiliary hosts. The signiﬁcance of this to the ecology of the parasite has never been evaluated. There is increasing concern as to the impact of climate change on the epidemiology of many parasitic diseases. In particular, it has been suggested that host switching may increase under the pressure of extreme climatic conditions. It is therefore timely to assess the role that aquatic molluscs may play in transmitting terrestrial nematodes, which include species of medical and veterinary importance such as Angiostrongylus cantonensis, A. vasorum, and Muellerius capillaris. The present review assesses the mechanisms of terrestrial nematode transmission through aquatic molluscs focusing on metastrongyloid and rhabditoid species, the importance of variable susceptibility of molluscan hosts, ﬁeld studies on natural occurrence within aquatic habitats, and the impact of extreme climatic events (ﬂoods and droughts) that may increase in frequency under climate change.","2010-06","2019-02-13 00:11:49","2019-03-11 22:52:48","2019-02-13 00:11:49","1041-1056","","07","137","","","Aquatic molluscs as auxiliary hosts for terrestrial nematode parasites","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/4F25X9IF/Morley - 2010 - Aquatic molluscs as auxiliary hosts for terrestria.pdf","","freshwater; drought; storm; downloaded by Brandon; downloaded by Jenna; fresh; excluded because review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For most natural populations, such as pest populations, large-scale and longterm surveys cannot be carried out at a high resolution. For instance, for population dynamics characterized by irregular abundance explosions, i.e., outbreaks, it is common to report detected outbreaks rather than measuring the population density at every location and time event. Here, we propose a mechanical-statistical model for analyzing such outbreak occurrence data and making inference about population dynamics. This spatiotemporal model contains the main mechanisms of the dynamics and describes the observation process. This construction enables us to account for the discrepancy between the phenomenon scale and the sampling scale. We propose the Bayesian method to estimate model parameters, pest densities and hidden factors, i.e., variables involved in the dynamics but not observed. The model was speciﬁed and used to learn about the dynamics of the European pine sawﬂy (Neodiprion sertifer Geoffr., an insect causing major defoliation of pines in northern Europe) based on Finnish sawﬂy data covering the years 1961–1990. In this application, a dynamical Beverton–Holt model including a hidden regime variable was incorporated into the model to deal with large variations in the population densities. Our results gave support to the idea that pine sawﬂy dynamics should be studied as metapopulations with alternative equilibria. The results conﬁrmed the importance of extreme minimum winter temperatures for the occurrence of European pine sawﬂy outbreaks. The strong positive connection between the ratio of lake area over total area and outbreaks was quantiﬁed for the ﬁrst time.","2009-02","2019-02-13 00:13:28","2019-03-12 21:01:50","2019-02-13 00:13:28","318-338","","2","71","","","Mechanical-Statistical Modeling in Ecology","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/S7X7KFIX/Soubeyrand et al. - 2009 - Mechanical-Statistical Modeling in Ecology From O.pdf","","freshwater; downloaded by Lillian; temperature; excluded because not extreme event","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Brazilian Pantanal is one of the world's largest freshwater wetlands and considered a priority landscape for wildlife conservation. It is subject to pluri-annual extreme dry and wet periods, which cause extreme flood and drought events, which strongly affect wildlife. Using the line-transect method, this study examined the distribution of densities and metabolic biomass of medium- to large-sized nonvolant mammals in forest, cerrado and floodplain landscapes, in an area with low anthropogenic influence, in the central area of the Brazilian Pantanal during a prolonged drought. Comparisons with a previous survey conducted during years of average rainfall in part of the study area suggest that population fluctuations of certain species are closely associated with water due to the drought. Results from this study showed that mammal assemblages varied between landscapes. Forested landscapes have the highest densities of mammals and are the most important in terms of relative energy consumption. In addition, at the time of the study, frugivores were found to have higher energy consumption than browser/grazers across the three landscapes; most fruits are produced in forested areas stressing their importance.

In each of these environments, organisms must be capable of surviving freeze–thaw cycles, persistent low temperatures for growth, extremes of solar radiation, and prolonged dormancy. These constraints may have been especially important during global cooling events in the past, including the Precambrian glaciations. One analogue of these early Earth conditions is the thick, landfast sea ice that occurs today at certain locations in the Arctic and Antarctic. These ice shelves contain liquid water for a brief period each summer, and support luxuriant microbial mat communities. Our recent studies of these mats on the Markham Ice Shelf (Canadian high Arctic) by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that they contain high concentrations of chlorophylls a and b, and several carotenoids notably lutein, echinenone and b-carotene. The largest peaks in the HPLC chromatograms were two UV-screening compounds known to be produced by cyanobacteria, scytonemin, and its decomposition product scytonemin-red. Microscopic analyses of the mats showed that they were dominated by the chlorophyte genera cf.

But Anglo-Australian settlement is younger and better documented, both in terms of scientific proxy data and historical sources, which include data on stocking rates that generally were light. Environmental concerns were voiced early, and a lively debate continues both among professionals and the lay public, with Australian geographers playing a major academic and applied role. This article addresses environmental degradation often attributed to early pastoralism (and implicit clearance) in the Tablelands of New South Wales. Methods include: (1) comparison of well-reported travel itineraries of 1817–1833 with modern land cover and stream channels; (2) critical reviews of high-resolution pollen profiles and the issues of Aboriginal vs. Anglo-Australian fire ecology; and (3) identification of soil erosion and gullying both before and after Anglo-Australian intrusion. The results indicate that (a) land cover of the Tablelands is little changed since prior to Contact, although some species are less common, while invasive genera of legumes have modified the ground cover; (b) the charcoal trace in pollen profiles prior to Contact supports an ecological impact of regular Aboriginal burning and rare, catastrophic fires; and (c) most stream channels were already entrenched (“gullied”) well before 1840, with repeated cut-and-fill cycles during the late Holocene, but before Contact. Land impairment has not been a major problem on the Tablelands, although the last two centuries have experienced cumulative and complex environmental change. This unexpected empirical picture suggests that, until high-technology intervention, increasing periodicity/magnitude of extreme drought/precipitation events had been the overriding trend in interior New South Wales, perhaps reinforced by burning. There is no support for an apocalyptic model of colonial environmental history.","2005-03-01","2019-02-13 00:25:57","2019-03-11 20:19:54","2019-02-13 00:25:57","80-111","","1","95","","","Livestock, Land Cover, and Environmental History","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/A83TIKJU/Butzer and Helgren - 2005 - Livestock, Land Cover, and Environmental History .pdf","","freshwater; drought; storm; downloaded by Brandon; fresh; excluded because not ecology","Australia; climatic perturbations.; fire ecology; gullying; pastoral degradation; vegetation change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper introduces, and summarises the key messages of, a series of papers that emanated from a symposium on the Role of Drought in the Ecology of Aquatic Systems, held in Australia in 2001. 2. Defining drought hydrologically is problematic because the return times, intensity, duration and long-term trends in low-flow periods are specific to regions and times. Droughts may instead be referred to as ‘significant low-flow periods’, many of which have been replaced by ‘anti-drought’ conditions in rivers as they are used increasingly as irrigation conduits. 3. Droughts can be divided into those that cause predictable, seasonal press disturbances and less predictable, protracted ‘ramp’ disturbances. However, while droughts may be ‘ramp’ disturbances, their effects on aquatic biota are most likely to be ‘stepped’ when geomorphological or hydrological thresholds are crossed, causing abrupt changes in biological community structure and ecosystem processes. 4. Physical, morphological, physiological or behavioural refugia confer resistance or resilience to riverine populations and communities that experience drought conditions. The physical and chemical parameters associated with refugia habitats and their formation, influence population parameters within, and interactions among, species and can have protracted reproductive consequences, even well after the cessation of the drought. 5. Fish, invertebrate and plant populations and assemblages seem to recover rapidly from drought. Most studies of the effects of drought, however, have arisen fortuitously and have involved relatively short temporal, and small spatial, scales. Innovative approaches, such as microsatellite DNA analyses, can reveal that the effects of drought may be profound and long-lasting, resulting in population bottlenecks and altering the course of the evolution of species. 6. During periods of drought, decreases in inputs of dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus may lead to carbon limitation to microbial metabolism, resulting in autotrophic production being favoured over heterotrophic production. 7. Long-term climate trends, as indicated by palaeoecological evidence, suggest that, at least for Australia, droughts are likely to occur more frequently in the future. Anthropogenic effects on climate are likely to exacerbate this. 8. It is important that drought is seen for what it is: a natural extreme of the flow continuum, with flooding at the other extreme. Thus, despite the potential for dramatic impacts on aquatic biota and the negative social connotations associated with such events, drought must be incorporated into river management plans.","2003","2019-02-13 00:30:00","2019-03-18 16:58:06","2019-02-13 00:30:00","1141-1146","","7","48","","","Drought and aquatic ecosystems","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/UVC8UZ2H/Humphries and Baldwin - 2003 - Drought and aquatic ecosystems an introduction.pdf","","freshwater; drought; storm; downloaded by Brandon; downloaded by Jenna; fresh; excluded because review","low flow; rivers; temporal and spatial scales","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Droughts are not easily defined other than by culturally driven judgements about the extent and nature of impact. Natural ecosystems are adapted to the magnitude and frequency of dry periods and these are instrumental in controlling the long term functioning of these systems. 2. In unregulated rivers, low flows are derived from water in long-term storage in the catchment, commonly as shallow groundwater. Four types of low flow sequences are evident for representative rivers from each of the seven flow regime zones in Australia and an arid zone stream: perennial streams with low annual flow variability that have seasonal low flows but do not cease to flow; perennial streams with high annual variability that cease to flow in extreme years; ephemeral streams that regularly cease to flow in the dry season; and arid zone streams with long and erratic periods of no flow. 3. Although Australian rivers record runs of consecutive years of low flows longer than would be expected theoretically, the departures from the expected are not statistically significant. Trends and quasi-cycles in sequences of low-flow years are observed over decadal time scales. 4. Examples of the effects of river regulation on low flows in southern Australia indicate that, while in detail the impacts of regulation vary, in general regulation mitigates the severity of low flows. 5. It is our contention that the indigenous biota of Australian rivers are adapted to the naturally occurring low flow conditions and that, while there is considerable scientific interest in the effects of climate change on stream ecology, such studies have little practical relevance for the management of indigenous biota in unregulated rivers. 6. The changes brought about by the regulation of rivers are much more rapid and dramatic than those which might occur as a result of climate change and it is possible to develop management procedures to mitigate them. In regulated rivers, the real problem may be ‘anti-droughts’– the removal of significant natural low-flow events from the flow pattern.","2003","2019-02-13 00:31:12","2019-03-18 17:42:43","2019-02-13 00:31:12","1147-1160","","7","48","","","Droughts and anti-droughts","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/APPPGNVA/McMahon and Finlayson - 2003 - Droughts and anti-droughts the low flow hydrology.pdf; /Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/NAKGNFYC/j.1365-2427.2003.01098.html","","drought; downloaded by Jenna; fresh; excluded - not about ecology","anti-drought; Australian rivers; low flows; regulated rivers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is followed by the review of existing methods of low-ﬂow estimation from streamﬂow time-series, which include ﬂow duration curves, frequency analysis of extreme low-ﬂow events and continuous low-ﬂow intervals, baseﬂow separation and characterisation of streamﬂow recessions. The paper describes the variety of low-ﬂow characteristics (indices) and their applications. A separate section illustrates the relationships between low-ﬂow characteristics. The paper further focuses on the techniques for low-ﬂow estimation in ungauged river catchments, which include a regional regression approach, graphical representation of low-ﬂow characteristics, construction of regional curves for low-ﬂow prediction and application of time-series simulation methods. The paper presents a summary of recent international low-ﬂow related research initiatives.

For some of these pathogens, there is a risk of the re-emergence of vector-borne diseases that were once widespread in Europe, but declined partly due to large-scale land-drainage projects. Some mosquito species exploit container habitats as breeding sites in urban areas; an adaptation to human-made micro-habitats resulting from increased urbanisation. However, many species thrive in natural wetland ecosystems. Owing to the impacts of climate change there is an urgent need for environmental adaptation, such as the creation of new wetlands to mitigate coastal and inland flooding. In some cases, these initiatives can be coupled with environmental change strategies to protect a range of endangered flora and fauna species by enhancing and extending wetland landscapes, which may by driven by European legislation, particularly in urban areas. This paper reviews field studies conducted in England to assess the impact of newly created wetlands on mosquito colonisation in a) coastal, b) urban and c) arable reversion habitats. It also considers the impact of wetland management on mosquito populations and explores the implications of various water and vegetation management options on the range of British mosquito species. Understanding the impact of wetland creation and management strategies on mosquito prevalence and the potential risk of increasing the levels of nuisance or disease vector species will be crucial in informing health and well-being risk assessments, guiding targeted control, and anticipating the social effects of extreme weather and climate change. Although new wetlands will certainly extend aquatic habitats for mosquitoes, not all species will become a major nuisance or a vector concern as a result. Understanding how the design and management of wetlands might exacerbate mosquito densities is crucial if we are to manage nuisance mosquitoes and control vector species in the event of a disease outbreak. This entomological evidence-base will ensure that control strategies achieve optimal efficacy at minimal cost.","2015","2019-02-13 14:52:44","2019-03-18 17:43:20","2019-02-13 14:52:44","142","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/ZIE9UGSG/Medlock and Vaux - 2015 - Impacts of the creation, expansion and management .pdf","","coastal; freshwater; storm; downloaded by Brandon; downloaded by Alex; excluded - review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Future shifts in the frequency and intensity of extreme floods will vary by region and could modify the geomorphological character of riverine habitat. The geomorphological structure of rivers determines the quality and quantity of habitat available for resident biota, and thus, changes to morphology from more extreme floods are likely to affect river ecology over and above the direct effects of the flood events themselves. Extreme floods can exacerbate the effect of multiple anthropogenic stressors, with potentially dramatic effects on freshwater ecosystems. For instance, high flows mobilise nutrients, sediment and toxic chemicals, and aid dispersal of invasive species, whereas land-use change and channelisation impair flood refugia and constrain recolonisation pathways. Extreme floods may also benefit riverine and riparian biota, overwhelming current anthropogenic constraints and infrastructure to increase habitat complexity and floodplain area. Management to protect human life and infrastructure from severe river flooding can alter channel geomorphology, habitat quality and ecology. However, flood prevention engineering that incorporates the natural form of rivers could potentially mitigate anthropogenic flood damage, in turn restoring habitat and historical ecosystem functioning. We examine potential changes in river channel and floodplain geomorphological characteristics resulting from altered extreme flooding regimes and consider likely implications for the management of the world's freshwater biota.","2015","2019-02-13 14:50:58","2019-03-15 14:17:31","2019-02-13 14:50:58","2477-2496","","12","60","","","Resetting the river template","","","","","","","en","© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/TWFJSM9V/Death et al. - 2015 - Resetting the river template the potential for cl.pdf; /Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/P8QRH3BK/fwb.html","","freshwater; storm; downloaded by Brandon; excluded - review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Subsequent ecosystem research was largely site-specific, that is, ecosystems were treated as ecological units with relatively discrete boundaries, often the ridges separating distinct watersheds. Later, starting in the latter decades of the 20th century, ecosystems were compared in terms of their efficiency in retaining energy and nutrients, ability to modify local abiotic conditions, and to resist or recover from disturbances. The advent of landscape ecology and stream continuum concepts during the 1980s broadened the perspective of ecosystems to a mosaic of interconnected patches that shared a common regional species pool and exchanged individuals, energy, and matter. Changes in the pattern of patch types could affect the distribution and exchange of energy and matter and alter local and regional climatic conditions. With growing public concern about effects of land use change, climate change, and invasive species, networks of long-term research sites, for example, the US Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program and National Environmental Observatory Network (NEON) and global networks of International Long Term Ecological Research (ILTER) and carbon flux towers (FLUXNET), established platforms on which ecosystem responses to, and effects on, environmental changes and disturbances could be measured (Peters et al., 2013; Van Cleve and Martin, 1991). Many of these sites have towers or construction cranes that permit access to the tops of forest canopies to facilitate measurement of interactions between the forest and atmosphere (Lowman et al., 2012). New technologies, such as high-resolution spectrophotometers, gas-exchange analyzers, and instruments for measuring eddy-covariance, permit precise measurements of carbon and nutrient fluxes among biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems (Irvine et al., 2005; Porder et al., 2005; Treuhaft et al., 2004), while improved isotopic detection methods permit identification of sources of atmospheric gases (Aranibar et al., 2006). The application of this technology to remote sensing techniques has revolutionized our ability to monitor changes in ecosystem conditions on a global scale. Researchers now can detect changes in local, regional, and global net primary productivity (R. Waring and Running, 1998; Yuan et al., 2007), net ecosystem productivity (Irvine et al., 2005; Misson et al., 2007; Treuhaft et al., 2004; D. Turner et al., 2005; Xiao et al., 2008), evapotranspiration rate (J. Zhang et al., 2009), foliage area, biomass and chemistry, especially water, lignin, nitrogen and, indirectly, phosphorus (Chambers et al., 2007; Porder et al., 2005), and drought or insect stress (Carter and Knapp, 2001; Nansen et al., 2009, 2010) using hyperspectral reflectance signatures, such as from airborne visible and infrared imaging spectrometry (AVIRIS). Data permit testing of cause-and-effect relationships between these ecosystem variables and global climate (J. Foley et al., 2003b; Janssen et al., 2008; Juang et al., 2007). We currently have an unprecedented ability to detect changes in ecosystem structure and function at local, regional, and global scales. Results of large-scale studies are demonstrating ecosystem responses to, and effects on, changing climate, land use, invasive species, etc. For example, removal of overstory trees from a site greatly increases albedo and reduces the ability of the ecosystem to modify local precipitation and ameliorate the impact of torrential rain (Trenberth, 1999), leading to dramatic increases in soil temperature, erosion, and sedimentation of streams (J. Foley et al., 2003a). Removal of all trees or vegetation from a site exacerbates these effects (J. Foley et al., 2003b; Janssen et al., 2008). Although small-scale harvest and/or conversion of forests may appear to be relatively innocuous, cumulative deforestation or reduction in average height of forests not only leads to regional warming and drying (Janssen et al., 2008; Juang et al., 2007; Meher-Homji, 1991) but has effects far downstream in terms of flooding of human communities and infilling of reservoirs (H. Guo et al., 2008). Furthermore, atmospheric turbulence generated by changes in vegetation cover can increase the intensity of storms (Hossain et al., 2009; Kishtawal et al., 2010). Increasing frequency of extreme weather events is likely to have greater effects on species survival and ecosystem function, including loss of ecosystem ability to buffer climatic conditions, than will changes in average conditions (Breshears et al., 2005; Gutschick and BassiriRad, 2010; Jentsch et al., 2007; Lubchenco and Karl, 2012). Insects have demonstrated capacity to modify environmental conditions. J.W. Moore (2006) described ways in which aquatic insects modify substrate and resource conditions. A number of herbivorous species are capable of dramatic alteration of vegetation structure and composition, changing habitat conditions for associated organisms (C.G. Jones et al., 1994), often in response to anthropogenic changes in environmental conditions (Raffa et al., 2008; Schowalter, 2008, see Chapter 2). This capacity of insects to alter anthropogenic designs for ecosystems requires that their responses to, and effects on, ecosystem conditions be addressed in any environmental policies or management decisions.","2016","2019-02-13 14:47:59","2019-03-11 23:30:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","Academic Press Ltd-Elsevier Science Ltd","London","English","","","","","Web of Science","","WOS:000416043500016","","","","freshwater; storm; downloaded by Brandon; book chapter; excluded - book chapter/review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Urbanization, as a global demographic trend, led to the increase in migration of people from rural regions to urban areas (especially in developing or under-developed countries) that caused congestion problems in cities with a number of documented effects on urban socio-ecological systems. Due to the urban population increase and expansion of anthropogenic activities, urban riverine systems as one of the most vulnerable components of urban ecology have been exposed to the crisis of ecological deterioration. As a result, their hydro-morphological characteristics changed, crucial functions and aquatic habitats have been lost.

We examined the effects of 12- and 24-h passive O2 exposure on previously anaerobic bacterial communities focusing on denitrification enzyme activity (DEA), N2O production, and bacterial community 16S rRNA and nitrous oxide reductase gene (nosZ) profiles after 12, 24, and 48 h of anaerobic recovery. Treatments experiencing 24-h O2 exposure had significantly higher DEA 12 h into anaerobic recovery than treatments undergoing 12-h O2 exposure. Initial N2O emissions were significantly lower in the 24-h O2 exposure treatments although by 24 h a dramatic spike (tenfold relative to the 12-h O2 exposure treatments) in N2O concentrations was observed. However, within 6 h (30-h anaerobic recovery) these differences were gone. Community nosZ profiles experiencing 24-h O2 exposure exhibited reduced diversity after 24-h recovery, which corresponded with an increase in N2O emissions. However, after 48 h of anaerobic recovery, nosZ diversity had recovered. These observations highlight the effects of short-term aerobic disruption on denitrification, as well as the effects on the denitrifier community profile. Together, these data suggest that recovery to ambient N cycling is exacerbated by disturbance length due to increased lag time and subsequent loss of denitrifier community diversity.","2018-03-01","2019-02-13 14:14:36","2019-03-13 02:06:59","2019-02-13 14:14:36","35-49","","1","52","","Aquat Ecol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","freshwater; storm; downloaded by Brandon; PDF not available; excluded because experimental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High-frequency observations and modeling of river fluxes in subtropical regions are required to understand nutrient cycling and predict water quality and ecological responses. In 2014, a normal hydrologic year, we carried out daily sampling of the North Jiulong River in southeast China, which drains an agricultural watershed and experiences the Asian monsoon climate. We focused on the distinct characteristics of two important inorganic nitrogen forms (ammonium and nitrate). Our results show contrasting hydrological controls on the seasonal timing and magnitude of ammonium and nitrate concentrations and loads, likely due to differing sources and transport pathways (surface runoff versus baseflow) to the river. Both nitrogen concentrations were enriched in the dry season and diluted in the wet season. Arrival of rains in the pre-wet period in March caused a “first flush” peak event with the highest concentrations of the year, during which ammonium peaked two weeks earlier than nitrate. In contrast, the majority of nitrogen transport occurred during the lower concentrations of the wet season, with seven storms inducing flood events that lasted 24% of the time, contributed 52% of the runoff, and exported 47% of the ammonium and 42% of the nitrate. We found that seasonally piecewise LOADEST models (for pre-wet, wet and post-wet periods) performed better (5–8% error) than a year-round model (12–24% error) in estimating monthly nitrogen loads. However, not all nitrogen dynamics are easily synthesized by this approach, and extreme floods might produce a greater deviation in estimating nitrogen loads. These findings represent important implications for coastal ecology and provide opportunity on improving observation and modeling.","2018-05-01","2019-02-13 14:09:04","2019-03-15 16:34:57","2019-02-13 14:09:04","382-391","","","213","","Journal of Environmental Management","Hydrological controls on nitrogen (ammonium versus nitrate) fluxes from river to coast in a subtropical region","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/RKDPRZWF/Gao et al. - 2018 - Hydrological controls on nitrogen (ammonium versus.pdf","","coastal; freshwater; storm; downloaded by Brandon; downloaded by Alex; excluded - does not describe extreme event","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The river alterations enabled an economic as well as an agricultural boom in the lower Rhine River valley. Today approx. 300'000 people live and work within this region due to the rectification work by the International Rhine Regulation IRR. Within the last decades the geotechnical as well as the safety standards have changed along with ecological restoration issues. Due to the significant increase of urban areas, the potential risk and vulnerability have increased tremendously. Flood control as a main goal: The main objective for the Alpine Rhine Project is an improvement of the current flood protection system. The design discharge of the project is 4'300 m(3)/s (equivalent to a 300-year flood), while also taking into account an extreme event of 5'800 m(3)/s. In order to achieve this goal, heavy construction measures with new levees and widening of the existing riverbed are necessary. All measures must fulfil today's requirements of both neighbouring countries Austria and Switzerland. This includes an improvement of the ecological situation, the preservation of the existing drinking water supply and a minimal impact on the environment during construction. Ecology and flood protection-a double win: According to the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) the lower stretch of the Alpine Rhine River is considered to be ""heavily modified"". In order to fulfil the WFD the river needs to be ecologically restored. According to the Swiss Water Protection Act the natural river state must be achieved as far as possible. However, all parties involved agree that the original historic morphology of the Rhine River can never be fully restored. Therefore the main goal of the project is to allow as much lateral river widening as feasible. A wider cross section of the Alpine Rhine River allows both ecological restoration and the required flood protection level.","2014","2019-02-13 14:59:14","2019-03-18 17:32:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","Crc Press-Taylor & Francis Group","Boca Raton","English","","","","","Web of Science","","WOS:000347410900005","","","","freshwater; storm; downloaded by Brandon; PDF not available; excluded - not about ecology","","Schleiss, A.

We synthesize the approaches used in river, reservoir and coastal water management in the event-driven subtropics of Australia, and the scientific research underpinning them. Land-use change has placed the receiving waters of Moreton Bay, an internationally-significant coastal wetland, at risk of ecological degradation through increased nutrient and sediment loads. The event-driven climate exacerbates this issue, as the waterways and ultimately Moreton Bay receive large inputs of nutrients and sediment during events, well above those received throughout stable climatic periods. Research on the water quality and ecology of the region’s rivers and coastal waters has underpinned the development of a world-renowned monitoring program and, in combination with catchment-source tracing methods and modeling, has revealed the key mechanisms and management strategies by which receiving-water quality, ecosystem health and ecosystem services can be maintained and improved. These approaches provide a useful framework for management of water bodies in other regions driven by episodic events, or where novel stressors are involved (e.g., climate change, urbanization), to support sustained ecosystem service delivery and restoration of aquatic ecosystems.","2013","2019-02-13 15:06:15","2019-03-18 17:25:47","","780-797","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/5G7V3XKM/Leigh et al. - 2013 - Science to support management of receiving waters .pdf","","coastal; freshwater; storm; downloaded by Brandon; downloaded by Alex; excluded - not about ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluated application of the HEC-HMS model to this environment by modelling flood events of various frequencies. Model results were validated and compared with the statistical estimates. The SCS curve number method was used for losses and runoff generation, and the model was very sensitive to curve number. The HEC-HMS flood estimates matched the statistical estimates reasonably well, and, over all return periods, were on average approximately 1% greater. However, the model generally underestimated flood peaks up to the 25-year event and overestimated magnitudes above this.

Numerical models are a powerful tool to study the water flows and pollutant transport, and recently a new generation of models is being developed to simulate the coupled flow and pollutant transport in shallow water. In this paper, a two-dimensional fully-coupled model of shallow water flows and pollutant transport was developed using a triangular unstructured grid (TIN: triangular irregular network), which is also an important module of the PIHM-Hydro modeling system. The model is based on a cell-centered upwind finite volume method using the HLL approximate Riemann solver. A multidimensional linear reconstruction technique and multi-dimensional slope limiter was implemented to achieve a second-order spatial accuracy. In order to make the model efficient and stable, an explicit-implicit method was used in temporal discretization by an operator splitting technique. A test case of the pollutant transport in a square cavity is used to validate the model. Then the model was further applied to two pollutant transport scenarios: microscale pollutant transport following dam break and mesoscale pollutant transport driven by storm surge in Galveston Bay. The numerical results show that the model could accurately predict the flow dynamics and pollutant transport in extreme events such as a dam break and a storm surge. According to the prediction of the model, the storm surge caused by the Hurricane Ike significantly extended the polluted area.","2012-01-01","2019-02-13 15:19:06","2019-03-18 17:28:40","2019-02-13 15:19:06","2098-2121","","","13","","Procedia Environmental Sciences","","18th Biennial ISEM Conference on Ecological Modelling for Global Change and Coupled Human and Natural System","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/B2HEEZPD/Li and Duffy - 2012 - Fully-Coupled Modeling of Shallow Water Flow and P.pdf","","coastal; freshwater; storm; downloaded by Brandon; downloaded by Alex; excluded - not about ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The hydrology and ecology of these delta lakes are dominated by cryospheric processes, specifically spring break-up ice jams, which typically produce the largest hydrologic event of the year. Despite the importance of ice-induced flooding in the delta, the patterns and processes characterizing these events are poorly understood. In this paper, archived records at a dozen hydrometric stations in the delta for the period from 1974 to 2006, improved with information from remotely sensed imagery, are used to assemble a break-up chronology for the delta, and examine the spatial and temporal patterns of break-up flooding. Analysis of backwater level and discharge at the Mackenzie River at Arctic Red River (MARR) station are used to explain the physical rationale of the resulting patterns. Results highlight years of extensive delta flooding, and within the subset of significant flood years, two event types are identified: (1) ice-driven events, with high backwater levels at MARR associated with high levels in the southern and eastern/western delta, and (2) discharge-driven events, with extensive high-water levels in the mid/outer delta and along Middle Channel, despite lower upstream peak water levels. Temporally, the break-up initiation during ice- (discharge-) driven events occurs earlier (later) than the delta average. These occur later (earlier) in the time-series that is trending toward earlier break-ups. The MARR station is determined to be a suitable index of delta peak water levels for continued investigation into the hydroclimatic controls on extreme hydrological events in the Mackenzie Delta.

The statistics of extremes have played only a very limited role in ecological modeling, despite the disproportionate influence of unusual disturbances on ecosystems. An overview of this theory is provided, with emphasis on recent developments that both make more efficient use of the available data on extremes and enable applications that are more ecologically realistic. Consistent with the emphasis on scale in ecology, scaling properties of extremes are emphasized. It is argued that the existence of distributions whose extreme upper tail is “heavy” (i.e., decreases at a relatively slow rate) implies that ecological disturbances are sometimes regarded as more “surprising” than they ought to be. The application focuses on modeling disturbances in paleoecology. Two examples are considered: the first, a sediment yield time series for Nicolay Lake in the high Arctic, reflects only the influence of hydrologic disturbances; the second, a sediment rate time series in the Chesapeake Bay, includes both climatic and anthropogenic influences. Strong evidence supports a heavy-tailed distribution for the Nicolay Lake sediment yield, but not necessarily for the Chesapeake Bay sediment rates. For each example, it is demonstrated how the statistics of extremes can readily incorporate information about covariates, such as large-scale atmospheric–oceanic circulation patterns or land use.","2005","2019-02-13 15:37:25","2019-03-18 17:16:04","2019-02-13 15:37:25","1124-1134","","5","86","","","Statistics of Extremes","","","","","","","en","© 2005 by the Ecological Society of America","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/3J7XAYZ3/Katz et al. - 2005 - Statistics of Extremes Modeling Ecological Distur.pdf; /Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/G2BSVR5C/04-0606.html","","freshwater; storm; downloaded by Brandon; excluded - modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the study we used 35 ¯ow variables for 62 New Zealand perennial rivers, which cover a wide range of ¯ow regimes. All ¯ow variables were calculated using daily mean ¯ows from a common 7-year period. They included general ¯ow variables (which express general features without focusing on extreme ¯ows, such as mean ¯ow and coef®cient of variation), high ¯ow variables and low ¯ow variables. Four groups of variables were identi®ed based on covariance among the sites through a principal components analysis. These groups were: (1) the size of the river (central tendency of magnitude); (2) the overall variability of ¯ow (including magnitude of high and low ¯ows); (3) the volume of high ¯ows; and (4) the frequency of high ¯ow events. The ecological relevance of each of the four groups is discussed. We also examined statistical properties of the ¯ow variables such as the inter-annual variability, which was low for the general ¯ow variables and high for variables that characterize the highest ¯oods.

Vegetation change in savannas has important implications for pastoral land-use, conservation management, and landscape-scale carbon storage, and informs theoretical debates about ecosystem function. This study seeks to determine the nature, extent and cause(s) of woody vegetation change in a seasonally flooded alluvial savanna habitat. Location The study area is located within the seasonally inundated alluvial zone of the tidal portion of the Victoria River, Northern Territory, Australia. The study area has been grazed by domestic stock since c. 1900, prior to which the area was inhabited and more likely regularly burnt by Aboriginal people for thousands of years. Methods Digital georeferenced aerial photographic coverages were used to examine and quantify woody vegetation change between 1948 and 1993. Transect surveys of woody and herbaceous vegetation were carried out to ground-truth air-photo results and determine the nature and causes of observed vegetation changes. Results There has been a dramatic increase in woody vegetation cover throughout the study area. Vegetation change patterns are roughly uniform across the full range of edaphic habitat variation and are unrelated to the depositional age of fluvial sediments. Two woody species, Eucalyptus microtheca and Excoecaria parvifolia, are predominantly responsible for observed increases. Demographic analyses reveal that woody invasions have been episodic and indicate that in most locations peak woody species establishment occurred in the mid-1970s. Grasses are almost absent in a majority of habitats within the study area. Instead, large areas are covered by scalded soil, dense invasive weed populations, and unpalatable forbs and sedges. What grasses do occur are predominantly of very low value for grazing. The condition of the herbaceous layer renders most of the study area almost completely non-flammable; what fires do burn are small and of low intensity. Main conclusions Multiple working hypotheses explaining observed patterns of woody vegetation increase were considered and rejected in turn. The only hypothesis consistent with the evidence is as follows: (1) observed changes are a direct consequence of extreme overgrazing by cattle, most likely when stocking rates peaked in the mid-1970s; (2) prolonged heavy grazing effected the complete transformation of much of the herbaceous vegetation to a new state that is not flammable; and (3) in the absence of regular fire mortality, woody vegetation increased rapidly. The relatively treeless system that existed in 1948 was apparently stable and resilient to moderate grazing levels, and perhaps also to episodic heavy grazing events. However, grazing intensity in excess of a sustainable threshold has forced a transition that is irreversible in the foreseeable future. Stable-state transitions such as this one inform debates at the heart of ecological theory, such as the nature of stability, resilience, equilibrium and carrying capacity in dynamic savanna ecosystems.","2003","2019-02-13 15:44:44","2019-03-11 23:32:54","2019-02-13 15:44:44","783-802","","5","30","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/UR3THJEY/Sharp and Whittaker - 2003 - The irreversible cattle-driven transformation of a.pdf","","coastal; freshwater; storm; downloaded by Brandon; downloaded by Alex; excluded - not about extreme events","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on narrative accounts from 36 interviews, a survey (n = 453) and 6 focus group discussions, we investigate the impacts of ﬂoods in general and speciﬁcally the July 2011 ﬂood event on women’s lives, livelihoods, and health. We draw on complementary perspectives from feminist political ecology and social vulnerability theory to understand the ways in which such events are perceived, experienced and managed by women of different socio-economic classes, households, and geographic locations. Thematic and content analyses were used to examine women’s perceptions of ﬂoods, while descriptive statistical analysis and chi-square test were employed to compare actual impacts. Results show that women in general expressed no concern about gendered vulnerability to ﬂooding as most believed ﬂood impacts were gender neutral. This dominant view however, was not supported by evidence in the post-July 2011 ﬂooding as impacts varied among income groups and neighbourhoods, and gender differences were apparent. Women in the low-income neighbourhood recorded higher impacts and slower recovery compared to other social categories of women and men. All impacts reported were statistically signiﬁcant between women in low and high income neighbourhoods but most were not signiﬁcant between women in middle and high income neighbourhoods. Gender relations and roles intersecting with place, class, employment status, and healthcare, were mediating factors that placed low-income women at greater risk of impacts than others. With climate change likely to induce more extreme events, a case is made for collaborative and institutional efforts to systematically boost urban poor women’s adaptive capacity through targeted programmes aimed at alleviating poverty and improving women’s access to housing, health care and alternative sources of livelihoods.","2013-12","2019-02-14 16:20:12","2019-03-11 17:11:46","2019-02-14 16:20:12","1714-1725","","6","23","","","Urban flooding in Lagos, Nigeria","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/RET4B66T/Ajibade et al. - 2013 - Urban flooding in Lagos, Nigeria Patterns of vuln.pdf","","coastal; storm; downloaded by Alex; excluded because not ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this review, we assess the potential impacts of climate change on tropical birds and discuss the factors that affect species’ ability to adapt and survive the impending alterations in habitat availability. Tropical mountain birds, species without access to higher elevations, coastal forest birds, and restricted-range species are especially vulnerable. Some birds may be especially susceptible to increased rainfall seasonality and to extreme weather events, such as heat waves, cold spells, and tropical cyclones. Birds that experience limited temperature variation and have low basal metabolic rates will be the most prone to the physiological effects of warming temperatures and heat waves. Mostly unknown species’ interactions, indirect effects, and synergies of climate change with other threats, such as habitat loss, emerging diseases, invasive species, and hunting will exacerbate the effects of climate change on tropical birds. In some models habitat loss can increase bird extinctions caused by climate change by 50%. 3.5 °C surface warming by the year 2100 may result in 600–900 extinctions of land bird species, 89% of which occur in the tropics. Depending on the amount of future habitat loss, each degree of surface warming could lead to approximately 100–500 additional bird extinctions. Protected areas will be more important than ever, but they need to be designed with climate change in mind. Although 92% of currently protected areas are likely to become climatically unsuitable in a century, for example only 7 or 8 priority species’ preferred climatic envelopes are projected to be entirely lost from the African Important Bird Area network. Networks of protected areas need to incorporate extensive topographical diversity, cover wide elevational ranges, have high connectivity, and integrate human-dominated landscapes into conservation schemes. Most tropical bird species vulnerable to climate change are not currently considered threatened with extinction, often due to lack of knowledge; systematically and regularly gathering information on the ecology, and current and future distributions of these species is an urgent priority. Locally based, long-term tropical bird monitoring and conservation programs based on adaptive management are essential to help protect birds against climate change.","2012-04","2019-02-14 15:21:50","2019-03-11 23:31:23","2019-02-14 15:21:50","1-18","","1","148","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/2FFD8PRE/Şekercioğlu et al. - 2012 - The effects of climate change on tropical birds.pdf","","coastal; heat; storm; downloaded by Alex; excluded - review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In laboratory trials, we controlled for intensity, variance and temporal patterning of both underwater and aerial body temperature. Predation rate decreased as underwater and aerial thermal stress episodes became temporally non-coincident, despite a similar intensity and variance among treatments. Experiments under constant conditions were a poor predictor of more complex environmental scenarios because of these strong temporal interactions.

Fish species living in thermally heterogeneous environments have developed physiological and behavioural adjustments that provide individuals with the phenotypic plasticity to respond to environmental changes within certain limits. When thermal changes exceed the ability of ﬁsh to adjust, energy supply is predominantly directed to fuel essential maintenance costs at the expense of growth and reproduction. In such circumstances, not only temperature, but also time of exposure, are elements that determine the adaptive value of phenotypic plasticity. The present study was designed to examine the consequences of acclimation of juvenile H. erectus to 18 and 30 °C on the phenotypic plasticity associated with exposure to acute thermal events (measured through the thermal limits) and chronic exposure during longer periods (measured through growth). Similar survival and growth was found in all seahorses that experienced acute exposure (~1 min) to temperatures ranging from 7 to 33 °C and 12 to 36 °C in both acclimation treatments, respectively. Chronic exposure to 30 °C compared to 18 °C, however, signiﬁcantly reduced seahorse growth. A thermal tolerance polygon calculated as 302 °C2 suggests that H. erectus has a wide tolerance to the extreme conditions commonly present in estuarine environments. Given that the amplitude in the thermal tolerance polygon was mainly due to an increase in the lower limits of the interval and that no minimum temperature threshold could be determined, thus suggesting that the populations from YP are near their upper thermal limit.","2016-10","2019-02-14 15:22:40","2019-03-18 17:41:05","2019-02-14 15:22:40","112-119","","","483","","","Thermal tolerance and phenotypic plasticity in juvenile Hippocampus erectus Perry, 1810","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/IMZD29MX/Mascaró et al. - 2016 - Thermal tolerance and phenotypic plasticity in juv.pdf","","coastal; heat; downloaded by Alex; excluded - experimental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing techniques were used to build a regional model to predict changes in the mean sea level for several future scenarios, showing susceptible areas to be ﬂooded. We have included new parameters to the model such as swell, mareal range or neotectonic factors aiming to better adjust it to the local conditions. The results showed a high risk of ﬂooding in the barrier beach and coastal areas of the Menor Sea, with a medium to very high degree of vulnerability for the most populated and touristic areas. The maximum and minimum expected increase of the water sheet for the 100 year scenarios ranged from +4.22 to +5.69 m. This methodology can establish sectors that need structural measures to minimize the impact of the sea level rise occurring due to natural tendency in the short or long term, as well as by extreme events such as storm surges or tsunamis. Furthermore, it can be used in other areas to assist land management decision makers to reduce or mitigate the vulnerability and risk presented against the rise of the sea level.","2018-03-12","2019-02-14 15:22:38","2019-03-18 17:39:51","2019-02-14 15:22:38","780","","3","10","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/7WMHVUXI/Martínez-Graña et al. - 2018 - Analysis of Flood Risk Due to Sea Level Rise in th.pdf","","coastal; heat; storm; downloaded by Alex; excluded - modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This prediction derives primarily from studies on insects and lizards and remains untested for other taxa with contrasting ecologies. We studied the HCT (heat coma temperatures) and ULT (upper lethal temperatures) of 40 species of tropical eulittoral snails (Littorinidae and Neritidae) inhabiting exposed rocky shores and shaded mangrove forests in Oceania, Africa, Asia and North America. We also estimated extremes in animal body temperature at each site using a simple heat budget model and historical (20 years) air temperature and solar radiation data. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that HCT and ULT exhibit limited adaptive variation across habitats (mangroves vs. rocky shores) or geographic locations despite their contrasting thermal regimes. Instead, the elevated heat tolerance of these species (HCT = 44.5 Æ 1.8°C and ULT = 52.1 Æ 2.2°C) seems to reﬂect the extreme temperature variability of intertidal systems. Sensitivity to climate warming, which was quantiﬁed as the difference between HCT or ULT and maximum body temperature, differed greatly between snails from sunny (rocky shore; Thermal Safety Margin, TSM = À14.8 Æ 3.3°C and À6.2 Æ 4.4°C for HCT and ULT, respectively) and shaded (mangrove) habitats (TSM = 5.1 Æ 3.6°C and 12.5 Æ 3.6°C). Negative TSMs in rocky shore animals suggest that mortality is likely ameliorated during extreme climatic events by behavioral thermoregulation. Given the low variability in heat tolerance across species, habitat and geographic location account for most of the variation in TSM and may adequately predict the vulnerability to climate change. These ﬁndings caution against generalizations on the impact of global warming across ectothermic taxa and highlight how the consideration of nonmodel animals, ecological transitions, and behavioral responses may alter predictions of studies that ignore these biological details.","2015-12","2019-02-14 15:22:35","2019-03-18 17:39:01","2019-02-14 15:22:35","5905-5919","","24","5","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/7TMR45RE/Marshall et al. - 2015 - Thermal tolerance and climate warming sensitivity .pdf","","coastal; heat; downloaded by Alex; Exclude - not extreme event","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Along coastal areas, ﬂooding associated with increased occupation has seriously impacted products and services generated by marine life, in particular the biotechnological potential that macroalgae hold. Therefore, this paper analyzes the available information on the taxonomy, ecology and physiology of macroalgae and discusses the impacts of climate change and local stress on the biotechnological potential of Brazilian macroalgae. Based on data compiled from a series of ﬂoristic and ecological works, we note the disappearance in some Brazilian regions of major groups of biotechnological interest. In some cases, the introduction of exotic species has been documented, as well as expansion of the distribution range of economically important species. We also verify an increase in the similarities between the Brazilian phycogeographic provinces, although they still remain different. It is possible that these changes have resulted from the warming of South Atlantic water, as observed for its surface in southeastern Brazilian, mainly during the winter. However, unplanned urbanization of coastal areas can also produce similar biodiversity losses, which requires efforts to generate long-term temporal data on the composition, community structure and physiology of macroalgae.","2012-08","2019-02-14 15:22:20","2019-03-18 16:55:34","2019-02-14 15:22:20","768-774","","4","22","","","Evaluation of impacts of climate change and local stressors on the biotechnological potential of marine macroalgae","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/IADGDKR6/Horta et al. - 2012 - Evaluation of impacts of climate change and local .pdf","","coastal; heat; temperature; downloaded by Rachel; marine; storm; downloaded by Brandon; downloaded by Alex; Excluded because review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In areas with reservoirs of disease, mosquito abundance information can help to identify the areas at higher risk of disease transmission. Using a Geographic Information System (GIS), mosquito abundance is predicted across the City of Chesapeake, Virginia. The mosquito abundance model uses mosquito light trap counts, a habitat suitability model, and dynamic environmental variables (temperature and precipitation) to predict the abundance of the species Culiseta melanura, as well as the combined abundance of the ephemeral species, Aedes vexans and Psorophora columbiae, for the year 2003. Remote sensing techniques were used to quantify environmental variables for a potential habitat suitability index for the mosquito species. The goal of this study was to produce an abundance model that could guide risk assessment, surveillance, and potential disease transmission. Results highlight the utility of integrating field surveillance, remote sensing for synoptic landscape habitat distributions, and dynamic environmental data for predicting mosquito vector abundance across low-lying coastal plains. Limitations of mosquito trapping and multi-source geospatial environmental data are highlighted for future spatial modeling of disease transmission risk.","2011-12-12","2019-02-14 15:22:04","2019-03-15 13:52:50","2019-02-14 15:22:04","2663-2681","","12","3","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/NVY86I2C/Cleckner et al. - 2011 - Remote Sensing and Modeling of Mosquito Abundance .pdf","","coastal; heat; storm; downloaded by Alex; excluded - modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An understanding of the atmospheric drivers of ROS events is required to better predict them and plan for environmental change. The spatially/temporally sparse network of stations in Alaska makes studying such events challenging, and gridded reanalysis or remote sensing products are necessary to ﬁll the gaps. Recently developed dynamically downscaled climate data provide a new suite of high-resolution variables for investigating historical and projected ROS events across all of Alaska from 1979 to 2100. The dynamically downscaled reanalysis data of ERA-Interim replicated the seasonal patterns of ROS events but tended to produce more rain events than in station observations. However, dynamical downscaling reduced the bias toward more rain events in the coarse reanalysis. ROS occurred most frequently over southwestern and southern coastal regions. Extreme events with the heaviest rainfall generally coincided with anomalous high pressure centered to the south/southeast of the locations receiving the event and warm-air advection from the resulting southwesterly wind ﬂow. ROS events were projected to increase in frequency overall and for extremes across most of the region but were expected to decline over southwestern/southern Alaska. Increases in frequency were projected as a result of more frequent winter rainfall, but the number of ROS events may ultimately decline in some areas as a result of temperatures rising above the freezing threshold. These projected changes in ROS can signiﬁcantly affect wildlife, vegetation, and human activities across the Alaska landscape.","2018-08","2019-02-14 15:20:13","2019-03-11 19:54:37","2019-02-14 15:20:13","1847-1863","","8","57","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/lillian/Zotero/storage/E8FWKVIE/Bieniek et al. - 2018 - Assessment of Alaska Rain-on-Snow Events Using Dyn.pdf","","coastal; heat; storm; downloaded by Alex; excluded because not ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
